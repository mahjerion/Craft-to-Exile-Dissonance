## [Unreleased]

## [3.1.3] - 2022-10-24

### Updates
- The Craft to Exile official server's "Pumpkin Harvest" event has begun! This event will last 2 weeks, from Oct. 24th (now) until Nov. 7th! Find Golden Pumpkin Seeds from vanilla undead mobs and witches, smashing pumpkins, and by giving Simple Farming Candy to the Market's Weathered Salesperson. Redeem these Golden Pumpkin Seeds at the Farming for Blockhead's Market for limited time special consumables and items!
- From the Farming for Blockhead's Market under the "Other" tab, choose from: Gilded Pumpkin Juice (grants 25% EXP bonus for 1 hour), RC, Lycanites Mobs fire blocks, Guardian's Charm (unique that causes you to stop counting towards party count in respect to EXP share, and prevents you from sharing EXP when killing mobs), Ring of the Undying (unique that prevents EXP gain), and a special tool capable of veinmining and tree-felling!
- If you're on the official server, check out the community made haunted house by Raiden and Theesle, accessible starting this weekend (end of Oct.) by appointment (DM Raiden (Onion#0733) or ask him in game to run it for you)! Complete the haunted house for some neat rewards, including Golden Pumpkin Seeds!
- Hidden Strength Amulet no longer provides lifesteal.

### Mine and Slash Updates
- Mob damage calculations have been completely overhauled... If you want to see the technical details see the next point. Turns out it didn't work the way I thought it did and all my previous increases and decreases to mob damage were not really doing anything! Basically, I've reduced variability of damage between mobs but increased the floor. We'll take vindicators and zombies as an example. We all know vindicators do tremendous damage when compared to zombies. While they still do more damage, the difference between the zombie and vindicator have been lessened (zombies now deal more damage but vindicators slightly less). This should also resolve the issue where "trash" mobs were doing nothing and sometimes you would encounter an extremely spiky mob. This also means players should invest more towards defenses now. This will also hopefully make mob damage more predictable and players will hopefully tackle content they can survive and not tackle higher content and then randomly get 1-2 shot by vindicators, vexes, etc. (since zombies and skeles do little damage).
- To understand how damage works, you should first know that every entity has a physical attack damage stat. For instance, currently, mobs have a physical attack damage stat of 10, which gets scaled by their level and then multiplied by the rarity and tier damage multiplier. However, unbeknownst to me, the actual formula for mob damage did not even take this base stat into account. It just takes their vanilla damage value (which we all knew it did) and scales it to their level. As a result, zombies had a functional physical attack damage stat of 3 while vindicators had a damage stat of 13, scaled to their level. The change I've made isn't a percentage increase, since that would just widen the gap between vindicators and zombies. Instead, I have reduced the ceiling and increased the floor of mob damage. The new formula is now [Vanilla DMG * 0.33 + 8 scaled to level], instead of just [Vanilla DMG scaled to level].
- Team Dungeon mob bonus increased damage has been halved (from 160-240% to now 80-120% increased damage). Now that damage is more predictable and in general, higher, I am able to reduce the Team Dungeon mob damage bonus. I was using zombie damage as a base line before which was a mistake on my part.
- Team Dungeon damage reduction bonus has been removed and instead the health multiplier has doubled but is now slightly variable. This should result in slightly less tanky mobs in Team Dungeons.
- Reduced variability in stats a bit. Generally, ceiling has been lowered and floor increased.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Mine and Slash, Craft to Exile Custom Uniques.

### Fixes
- Fixed a bug where Sweeping Strike was taunting enemies.
- Fixed a bug where entity-specific damage multipliers were not applying to mob spell damage.

## [3.1.2b] - 2022-10-21

### Mine and Slash Updates
- You can now configure the max distance for EXP share (thanks Thorinori!).

### Mod Updates
- Updated Mine and Slash.

### Fixes
- Fixed an issue where some buffs that increased movement speed would sometimes be overridden by movement speed debuffs.
- Fixed floating mob names on Neat bar (thanks Raiden!).

## [3.1.2] - 2022-10-19

### Updates
- Xaero's Update Alert: back up your Xaero's Waypoints and WorldMap folders!
- Increased mana regen flat and percent stat amounts.
- Reduced energy regen percent amount slightly.
- Spell Blade has been changed to provide flat fire attack damage and infusion instead of the old transfer stat and infusion. The old transfer stat was not working as intended.
- Poisoned Weapons has been changed to provide phys to nature conversion rather than the old transfer stat.
- Increased Rock Slide radius (which makes it better for AOE but worse for single target DPS).
- Rock Slide tick rate is now 10 instead of 8 (every half second now).
- Given the nature of how Force tree requires so many points, all strikes, extensions, finishers, as well as Asura, have been changed to have a max level of 8, instead of 16, 12, 8, and 16, respectively.
- Power and Wisdom Form (and their respective synergy's) max level have been reduced from 8 to 4.
- Empower and Enlighten stacks now cap at 3 instead of 5.
- Empower now provides a base of 21% increased damage at 3 stacks instead of 15% at 5 stacks.
- Enlighten now provides a base of 15% energy regen and 21% faster cast at 3 stacks instead of 15% of both at 5 stacks.
- Increased Asura damage by about 25%.
- Asura no longer requires a Combo Starter or Extension stack. Asura should now be less clunky to use thanks to this change and the Empower/Enlighten stack change.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Mine and Slash, Xaero's, CraftPresence.
- Fixed a bug where Natural Empowering was causing lots of lag.
- Fixed a bug where Flowing River Extension heal was not applying to self.
- Fixed a bug where infusion stat was increasing damage by an additional 100% mistakenly.
- Fixed a bug where the Sanguine Casting mob affix was applying more stacks than it should have been.
- Probably fixed a bug where debuffs were being applied to vanilla team members (slash party should still be fine).

## [3.1.1c] - 2022-09-30

### Mine and Slash Updates
- Reduced Hunting Wolf attack scaling by 25% per level.
- Bleed and mob curses deal a minimum of 1 damage.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Mine and Slash.

### Fixes
- Fixed a bug where all entities had 95% chance to dodge and 95% damage reduction.

## [3.1.1b] - 2022-09-30

### Mod Updates
- Updated Mine and Slash.

### Fixes
- Fixed an issue where armor going below 0 wasn't actually increasing damage.
- Fixed an issue where Electrical Discharge synergy wasn't applying Lightning Essence stacks (for real this time).

## [3.1.1] - 2022-09-30

### Updates
- Simple Magnet's magnets are no longer salvageable.

### Mine and Slash Updates
- Changed armor penetration so that it subtracts the % of armor pen off the final armor % reduction value. So an armor reduction of 40% met with 8% armor pen would result in 32% armor reduction. Before, the flat armor value was multiplied by 1 - the armor pen amount, so 500 armor met with armor pen would be multiplied by 0.92. This means that armor pen will work more similarly to how elemental pen works.
- Armor Penetration can cause enemies to take extra damage if their armor % reduction is lower than the penetration value.
- Armor can now go below 0.
- Force damage spells have been changed a bit. Finisher and Extension spells have had their damage reduced, and scaling per level has been reduced for Finisher, Extension, and Starter spells. Additionally, Asura scaling has been reduced.
- Heart of Ice, Healing Wave, Wish, and Nature's Balm healing values have increased by 50%.
- Chilling Field level 1 radius has increased but the radius per level has decreased. At max level, it is still the same as before.
- Whirlpool radius per level has decreased by about 18%.
- Tidal Wave and Rime Blade have had their damage reduced. Tidal Wave also fires less projectiles at max level and casts fewer times at max level. Tidal Wave was leagues ahead of other attack spells, and while unpopular, still needed to be brought in line with the other spells.
- Lightning Spear and Chain Lightning damage have increased by about 10%-20%.
- Power Surge flat lightning attack damage reduced by 40%.
- Charged Sweep level 1 radius has increased but the radius per level has decreased. At max level, it is still the same as before.
- Charged Sweep mana scaling is now 14% -> 21% instead of 7% -> 14%.
- Rock Slide mana cost has increased by about 25%.
- Rock Slide cooldown has increased by a flat 2s.
- Poison Cloud cooldown reduced by 1s.
- Poison Cloud mana cost at max level has been reduced by 11%.
- Poison Cloud radius reduced by 1.
- Poisoned Weapons flat nature attack damage reduced by 33%.
- Martyrdom health scaling is now 30% -> 45% instead of 25% -> 35%.
- Blessing mana on hit effect has been reduced by 33%.
- Magma Flower radius per level has decreased by about 18%.
- Volcano base value per level has increased by 11%.
- Burn damage has increased by about 20-25%.
- Animate Scythe health scaling is now 12% -> 24% instead of 8% -> 18%.
- Animate Scythe health cost and energy cost have been increased.
- Hellfire Cloak level 1 radius has increased but the radius per level has decreased. At max level, it is still the same as before.
- Blight damage has increased by about 50-60%.
- Cripple damage has increased by about 33%.
- Malevolent Offering cast time now decreases with level.
- Reduced mob armor stat by 75%.
- Increased mob elemental resists by 20% (from 12.5% base to 15%).
- Harmony now causes lifesteal effects to cap based on max magic shield rather than health.
- Overflowing Vitality now has a ele multi of -15% instead of -50%.
- Overflowing Vitality now adds flat phys damage based on 2% of your max health instead of 1%.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Mine and Slash.

### Fixes
- Fixed Divine buffs being max level 10 instead of 8.
- Fixed a bug where Electrical Discharge synergy wasn't applying Lightning Essence.
- Fixed some missing stats on Lightning and Frost Shield prefixes.

- Fixed some missing assets.

## [3.1.0] - 2022-09-28

### Updates
- Players have been provided with an all reset potion due to the substantial changes.
- Unique item's stats have a lower ceiling. Before, unique item stats had the potential to be twice as high as any other item type (set, runeword, legendary). Now it caps at 1.5x.
- Set item chance to spawn on common items is now 20% instead of 15%.
- Set item chance to spawn on rare items is now 35% instead of 30%.
- Set item chance to spawn on legendary items is now 75% instead of 50%.
- Set items that had a max level spawn of 100 have been updated to 120.
- A lot of rare set items have been made less rare (10x more common than previously). This includes but is not limited to Immortal King, Mavina's Battle Hymn, the slayer sets, Trang-Oul's Avatar, etc.
- Trang-Oul's Avatar now provides a massive bonus to DoT damage as the 5 piece bonus instead of health regen, and now provides health regen as the 2 piece bonus instead of a moderate bonus to DoT damage.

### Mine and Slash Updates
- Changed (almost) all stats to function additively rather than multiplicatively. I will illustrate the difference with an example. Say you have a Fireball that has a base value of 100 fire damage, 50% spell damage, and 50% fire spell damage. Before, That 100 fire damage would be increased by 50% spell damage, resulting in 150 damage, which would then be increased again by the 50% fire spell damage, resulting in 225 fire damage. However, with the new changes, 100 fire damage would be increased by 50% spell damage resulting in 150 fire damage. The last 50% from fire spell damage would apply once again to the base value of 100, resulting in 100 fire damage + 50 (from spell damage) + 50 (from fire spell damage), which is 200 fire damage. The only multiplicative stats are critical damage, the Pain Control trait, and True Hit trait. The reason for this change is three-fold. 1. I found the scaling to be very inconsistent throughout the game. Level 1-50 were straight-forward enough, but scaling past 60 was exponential and players were able to reach an extremely high ceiling. Because of this, very few builds were truly able to solo "team dungeon" content (which was never intended to be easy). This leads me to my second point. 2. Because of how multiplicative stats work, this meant that spells or builds that could access more modifiers had the potential to scale much more than other stats. Given the example earlier, let's take Fireball versus Martyrdom. Fireball is a fire spell that can take advantage of spell damage, fire/elemental spell damage, fire damage, all fire damage, fire focus, and many more. Having only 10% in 5 of these stats would result in the damage being increased by about 77%! Whereas Martyrdom can really only access spell damage, weapon damage, and in some cases, phys gained as x stats. This means that Fireball users dipping into all the stats had them multiplying off of each other for a much higher ceiling of damage, which makes sense, but is not friendly to all builds. By changing these stats to additive, the Martyrdom player can stack all high stats into weapon damage, and achieve a similar outcome from a Fireball caster with investment into spell damage, fire focus, and fire spell damage, for example. Similarly, another Fireball caster with only spell damage can still achieve a similar output to one with many different stats modifying Fireball. This leads me to my last point. 3. Accessibility. Most players would not know that the stats are multiplicative, and would probably start of the game stacking spell damage, or some similar stat. However, because the game has always been multiplicative, naturally, I've balance mid-late game around this. This resulted in players hitting a wall and requiring more defined builds to tackle higher-level content. With this change, I can reduce the scaling of enemies and make the mid-late game more accessible to newer players who not aware of how the stat scaling works. Hopefully these changes make sense. Please bear with me as this is a relatively large shake-up, and I will likely need to rebalance mob scaling and damage a bit over the next few patches.
- Steady Hand trait now gives 25% increased damage instead of 15% due to the distinction of "more" stats.
- Life/Magic Steal effects are now capped at 10% of your max HP per hit.
- Lowered volume of bolt effects.
- Lowered mob damage by about 20-25%.
- Reduced radius of Lightning Caster mobs by 33%.
- Venom Caster mobs now apply the curse on strike rather than on being struck.
- Reduced potency of Venom Caster mobs. They now reduce resists by 20% instead of 25%.
- Frost Shield cooldown now scales from 75s to 55s instead of 75s to 60s. This is an overall buff. At max overlevel, Frost Shield will have a cooldown of 35s instead of 45s. This means substantially less cooldown reduction is required to hit 100% upkeep.
- Whirlpool now has a non-scaling tick rate of 20 instead of scaling from 30 to 20. That means at max overlevel, it will still be at 20 instead of going down to 10.
- Blizzard tick rate now scales from 1.5s to 1.25s instead of 1.5s to 1s at max level.
- Reduced the overall mana cost of Blizzard by about 8%.
- Blizzard radius per level has been reduced by 50%.
- Blizzard mana cost at level 1 has been increased but the cost at max level remains unchanged (these changes happen after the mana cost reduction outlined above). This means that mana cost per level has been reduced by about 50%, and overleveling the spell will result in a lower mana cost than previously.
- Blazing Inferno attack scaling has increased by about 30%.
- Summon Archon mana cost at max level has been reduced by 18%.
- Magma Flower mana cost at max level has been reduced by about 12%.
- Reduced Volcano base damage by about 40%. Attack scaling remains unchanged.
- Volcano tick rate is now unchanging with level and is a static 20 (tick every 1s).
- Reduced the mana cost of Volcano at max level slightly.
- Volcano mana cost at level 1 has been increased but the cost at max level remains unchanged (these changes happen after the mana cost reduction outlined above). This means that mana cost per level has been reduced by about 50%, and overleveling the spell will result in a lower mana cost than previously.
- Steam Cloud cooldown at max level has been reduced from 20s to 16s.
- Steam Cloud base damage at lower levels has been increased.
- Electrical Discharge now deals 20% of enemies remaining HP instead of 18%, but is now classified as Bolt damage. It will no longer receive bonuses from spell damage. Elemental damage will still apply.
- Electrical Discharge radius per level has been reduced by half.
- Electrical Discharge synergy chance has been reduced to 50% at max level instead of 60%, due to the change of max level.
- Power and Critical Surge mana cost per level has been reduced by about 40%.
- Thunderstorm synergy now reduces tick rate by 5 instead of 10 (nerf), but increases mana cost by a base value of 3 instead of 5 (buff).
- Thunderstorm mana cost at level 1 has been increased but the cost at max level remains unchanged. This means that mana cost per level has been reduced by about 50%, and overleveling the spell will result in a lower mana cost than previously.
- Purifying Flames base value has been reduced by about 20%.
- Purifying Flames energy cost has increased by about 50%.
- Whirlwind tick rate now increases per level like it used to instead of always hitting 20 times in 6 seconds. It now scales up to 30 times in 6 seconds, and if max overleveled, 40 times in 6 seconds.
- Whirlwind attack scaling now scales from 50% to 100% instead of 50% to 80%. These Whirlwind changes were made in response to the change in max level change. This means Whirlwind can require more investment, but the ceiling is much higher if players decide to main this spell.
- Rock Slide damage has been reduced slightly.
- Rock Slide cooldown at max level has increased by about 60%.
- Venom Load tick rate is now every 15 ticks instead of 10 (0.75s instead of 0.5s).
- Hunting Wolf summon mana cost has been reduced substantially.
- Bone Squall scales from 4 to 7 casts in 1.5s instead of 4 to 6 casts.
- Increased the penalty to energy and energy regen for Resourceful talent.
- Readjusted the max level of spells to standardize them. Generally, the max level for spells will be 4, 8, 12, or 16. The changed max levels are listed below. Lowering the max level is generally a buff, as it requires less points to reach the same potential, and requires less + skills for more hitting overlevel cap. Generally, mainable spells will have higher max level, support/buffs will have a max level of about 8, and secondary spells will have a max level of about 12.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Mine and Slash, CraftPresence.

### Fixes
- Fixed an issue where infusion stat was reducing damage.
- Fixed a bug where Empower, Enlighten, and Rally effects were causing massive lag.
- Fixed some missing localization.

## [3.0.3] - 2022-09-16

### Updates
- Xaero's Update Alert: back up your Xaero's Waypoints and WorldMap folders!
- Increased mob scaling so that they're about 50% stronger at level 120 compared to before. Levels 1-70 remains mostly unchanged.
- Runeword weightings have been shifted so none should be nearly impossible to find now. Last Wish, Undying Magic, and Chains of Honor weightings have been reduced a bit.
- Sets that had a weighting of 10000 have been adjusted to 6666 - similar to Runeword weightings. This should make the rarer sets appear significantly more frequently.
- The unique nature and lightning bracelet now provide viality and luck, respectively, instead of stamina and dexterity.
- Uniques providing flat critical hit chance have had that stat lowered a bit.
- Replaced some instances of critical damage in suffixes with more relevant stats. For example, of "element" Dissonance now provide stats such as increased healing, faster cast rate, and increased DoT damage instead of critical damage in addition to their increased elemental resistance (which remains unchanged).
- of Giants and of Behemoths no longer provide critical damage and now provide armor. Additionally, of Behemoths is an "upgrade" to of Giants instead of being the exact same, and retains its rarity and level req.
- Ring prefix Eternal Field now provides magic shield regen percent instead of magic shield regen flat.
- Ring prefix Unending field now provides magic shield regen flat and percent instead of only magic shield regen flat.
- The magic siphon prefix is now less rare. It's the one that provides magic shield steal.
- Prefix Heavenly Skin now provides more armor and some elemental resists, but no longer provides health.
- New prefix: Elusive, which is a rarer and better version of Evasive. It also provides some elemental resists.
- New prefixes: Charged and Bursting, which are equivalent to Hardened/Evasive and Heavenly Skin/Elusive but instead of providing armor they provide magic shield.
- New prefixes: Enchanted, Lightened, and Tempered, which can only appear on Cloth armor, Leather armor, and Plate armor, respectively, provide percent bonuses to the primary defense type of that armor. Eg. Enchanted provides magic shield percent and can only spawn on Cloth armor. At the moment, many of the affixes between armor types overlap. These new prefixes will hopefully make each armor type have a stronger identity when choosing defensive options.
- The "element" shield prefixes now provide more interesting stats. They still provide elemental resists, but they no longer all provide health percent and armor. Frost Shield now provides health and mana, Fire Shield now provides magic shield and armor, Lightning Shield now provides magic shield and mana, and Nature Shield still provides health and armor.
- Suffix of Godhood no longer provides a health percent instead of health multi, and gives the same amount of dodge as armor.
- Suffix of Immortality now provides extra health and no longer provides armor.

### Mine and Slash Updates
- Increased Team Map difficulty.
- Added a new Game Changer talent: Clever Escapist - can be found in the bottom right of the tree. On a successful dodge, receive a 5s buff that gives 10% increased damage and 20% damage reduction.
- Steady Hand has been moved to the very bottom of the tree.
- Steady Hand stats have been streamlined. Nothing has changed functionally.
- Reduced Magical Life health penalty from -15% to -10%.

- The left side of the talent tree that has the Phys Gained stats now has nodes that actually are useful leading up to it.
- Sources of the flat core stats have been lowered (eg. instead of getting 9 Vitality, you may receive 6 instead on an item).
- Reduced Critical Damage stat values by about 25%.
- Increased floor of health stat values.
- Increased health percent stat values.
- Increased the flat stat values of magic shield substantially, but reduced the percent stat values. This should make magic shield a little stronger at lower to mid levels, and less powerful on the upper end.
- Increased Healing variance has been reduced, floor has been increased and ceiling decreased. Before it was 5-20 now the base value is 10-15.
- Reduced Arctic Armor regen penalty by 25%.
- Reduced Critical Surge, Power Surge, and Lightning Spear's bolt synergy damage by about 25-33%.
- Venom Load max level is now set to 12 rather than 4. It took too few points for it to become very effective. The spell should require a bit more investment.
- Venom Load radius per level has been reduced so that by max level it should have a radius of 4 instead of 5.
- Venom Load duration now scales from 3s to 5s instead of 5s to 7s.
- Venom Load mana cost has increased by about 10%.
- Venom Load cast time has increased by 50%.

### Updates
- Leviathan dungeon can now spawn in badlands as well, which should also reduce the chance of crashing when opening a specific chest.

### Mine and Slash Updates
- Reworked Venom Load since the self-damage was not working properly. Instead of working like Righteous Flame from POE, it now works like Blade Vortex. It now has no cooldown and a very short cast time. You can have up to 10 stacks of Venom Load, and for each stack, you will deal Nature DoT Damage to nearby enemies, which scales with your health. At level 1, each stack will deal 2% of your max health every half second (max 20%), and at max level, each stack will deal 4% of your max health every half second (max 40%).
- Fixed Raging Dragon Extension not expending a starter stack and generating an extension stack.

- Fixed an issue where spells recovering Magic Shield, Mana, and Energy were not functioning at all.
- Fixed an issue where Arcane Devotion was giving 10 times the amount of flat magic shield as intended. This fix should prevent players from getting a boatload of MS with no investment.
- Fixed a registry error.

## [3.0.1] - 2022-08-26

### Updates
- This update aims to improve currencies by reworking some of the existing ones, and adding 3 new types. I am also trying to make RC more relevant by adding new purchase-able items to the shop.
- Reduced unique rune and currency drop rate slightly.
- Updated the Calemi Market to have more useful items such as Negatite, and a Currency Box.
- Key Of New Dawn can no longer be crafted and can only be found from drops.

### Mine and Slash Updates
- Orb of Transmutation and Stone of Hope now retain the item stats when upgrading rarity!
- Orb of Transmutation always upgrades from common to uncommon, whereas Stone of Hope retains its functionality and will roll one rarity or more higher.
- Added a new currency orb, Orb of Chances, that can reroll secondary stats.
- Added a new currency orb, Orb of Alchemy, that turns common rarity items into rare.
- Using an Orb of Transmutation, Orb of Alchemy, and Stone of Hope will now retain the item identification status. They will also take into account if an item is runed, and will add a rune slot if appropriate.
- Reduced the attack scaling of almost every Force attack spell. They should be closer to what you'd expect from attack spells of other trees.
- Increased the energy cost of almost every Force attack spell. Currently, you don't even need to invest into Energy. I want players to have to invest a bit into Energy to upkeep the quick combos.
- Added more particle and sounds effects to Flowing River Extension.
- Empower now grants increased damage instead of physical attack damage. Flat physical attack damage was too strong in the early game. Increased damage should scale better. This will make it more useful in party play as well.
- Increased Enlighten Faster Cast Rate and Energy Regen buff.
- Increased the base damage of Burn, Blight, and Cripple significantly.
- Increased the duration of Burn and Cripple.
- Ice Blade now provides Frost Infusion.
- Improved Flame Blade tooltip to specify spell damage.
- Power Surge now provides more Lightning Attack Damage.
- Reduced the the radius of Poison Cloud by about 20% at max level.
- Reduced the base value of Soul Shred effect slightly since it scales with magic shield anyway.
- Soul Shred now accurately says "DoT" instead of spell damage.
- Bone Squall now always has a 3s cooldown instead of scaling from 6s to 3s.
- Whirlwind now lasts a static 7 seconds (still affected by duration modifiers) instead of scaling from 7s -> 13s.
- Whirlwind tick rate no longer increases. It now will always strike 20 times within 7 seconds (once every 7 ticks), instead of scaling from 20 times within 7 seconds to 80 times within 13 seconds (once every 3.25 ticks).
- Whirlwind attack scaling per level has increased so that by max level each hit does 25% more damage than previously. I recognize this is a nerf to overall DPS but these changes should 1. make whirlwind feel a bit better to play instead of it lasting an entire 13s, and 2. ease up on server load when the skill is active. Currently, the particles and the rate at which calculations are done with so many hits is putting too much load on the server.
- Whirlwind cooldown has been lowered to compensate for the reduced duration.
- Whirlwind mana cost and energy cost have been lowered slightly as well.
- Changed Conjurer spell damage penalty to be a flat -50% instead of -80% multi. This could be worse in some cases.
- Conjurer now provides 15% increased duration instead of 10% cooldown reduction.
- Ruthless now gives 25% increased DoT damage instead of 30%.
- Ruthless now also gives 10% increased duration.
- You can now learn a third Mastery tree at level 100 instead of 120.
- Minimum Health is now 10 instead of 1.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Mine and Slash.

### Fixes
- Fixed missing Gauntlets assets.
- Fixed Blessing and Angelic Raiment to not be an "aura" buff.

## [3.0.0] - 2022-08-25

### Updates
- First and foremost: thank you once again to Skullbushi for the amazing icon art for the new mastery tree.
- Xaero's Update Alert: back up your Xaero's Waypoints and WorldMap folders!
- Four new unique items: Hellfire Torch for the new tree, Fighter's Chain, Facebreaker Gauntlets (Tier 4), and Radiance Gauntlets (Tier 2).
- Players have been provided with an All Reset Potion for this update.
- Keep Inventory gamerule is now on by default.
- Added some new Homestead quests spotlighting Bountiful Boards.
- Removed some impossible to complete Beastiary quests, or reworked them into something possible.
- EXP loss on death is now a STATIC 5% instead of 25% of your current exp. This was a bug, sorry everyone. Additionally, dying past level 99 results in 2.5% loss instead of 5%.
- Updated the cauldron quest to mention Orbs as off-hands as well.

### Mine and Slash Updates
Mastery Changes:
- NEW MASTERY TREE: Force - utilize the unique brawler-type spells in this tree to deal tremendous damage or support your allies. The force tree has 4 main types of spells: Strikes, Extensions, Finishers, and Buffs. Strikes, Extensions, and Finishers are all attack spells. Use a Strike to gain a Combo Starter effect, which is required and expended upon use by Extension attack spells. Similarly, Extension attack spells will gain you a Combo Extension effect, which is required and expended by Finishers. Use the different types of Strikes, Extensions, and Finishers to "build your own combo" and create your own truly unique playstyle! For example, for an elemental combo, you might start with Elemental Strike (all elements) -> Raging Dragon Extension (fire/lightning) -> Elemental Vengeance Finisher (all elements, big AOE)! Look below for more combo examples... The possibilities are endless! Buffs are straight forward, there are two types of buffs: Empower and Wisdom. Empower grants an increase in damage, whereas Wisdom grants increased regeneration and cast speed. There are ways to provide these to yourself and your allies! Two unique things about the Force tree is that (almost) all spells only cost energy, and are not affected by cooldown reduction. However, these short cooldown attack spells can still be used in rapid succession. Be sure to mix them up!
- Support your allies with Goading Strike (AOE taunt) -> Flowing River Extension (frost, heal allies) -> Earthen Smash Finisher (AOE nature, increase ally defenses).
- Go for big physical damage with Piercing Strike (lowers def) -> Rallying Sweep Extension (AOE, increase ally speed and damage) -> Sweeping Strike (AOE) -> Triple Attack Extension (3x hits) -> Omnislash Finisher (high physical burst).
- Apply Spell Blade + Flame Blade and take advantage of the on-attack effects, and use Piercing Strike -> Triple Attack Extension -> Omnislash Finisher.

General Changes:
- NEW WEAPON TYPE: Gauntlets - once implemented in an indev version, this item type was quickly scrapped as it was logistically difficult to show how a player might "wield" a gauntlet in Minecraft... However, with the new Force tree, it just made sense to implement it to the best of my ability. These quick-acting weapons can really leave a mark on your opponents. They attack as fast as daggers and do more damage at the expense of more energy! (Sorry for the crappy weapon models, I'm not an artist).
- Added a Reset All command which resets stats, spells, and talents at once. Useful for testing builds.
- Add Remove Talent Potion now gives you 3 removal points rather than 1.
- Added a new craftable Reset All potion that uses 1 of each reset potion.
- Charge, Healing Aura, Inferno Quake, Gorgon's Gaze, Arctic Blast, and Soul Shred are now properly tagged as Area spells and display their "radius" which is actually the distance in front of the caster. Increased Area stats should now properly affect these spells.
- Increased bow and crossbow base damage.
- Mob base damage has increased slightly.
- Lowered mob armor slightly.
- Increased mob health in team dungeons.
- Fixed an issue where team dungeons were giving a 3x multiplier on exp instead of 2x.
- Fixed a bug where if you were on a team or in a party, you couldn't hit yourself. Which also should fix Venom Load not being able to kill the user.
- AOE spells now specifically look for enemies only.
- Fixed some instances of "Water" and "Thunder" to "Frost" and "Lightning".
- Implemented a fix where if you die multiple times at once somehow, you will only lose EXP once.
- Lowered particle counts for some AOE spells.
- Lowered the radius of some of the basic melee attack spells.
- Improved tooltips for some confusing stats such as weapon damage and attack damage.
- Lowered mob difficulty at lower levels slightly.

Stat Changes:
- Renamed Lucky to Prosperous, and Luck to Lucky. The core stat Luck remains unchanged.
- Reduced sources of lifesteal and spellsteal stats.
- Reduced potency of critical damage stats substantially. Critical hit remains untouched.
- Increased physical damage of weapons when they only roll physical damage so they're more in line with multi-element weapons.
- Reduced the attack scaling of attack spells to compensate for the increase in physical damage of weapons.
- Since Elemental Attack Damage is already taken into account when using attack spells and summons in their scaling, it will no longer be added "additionally" to the attack when damage is dealt. No more double dipping for free. Please also keep in mind that Elemental Attack Damage Percent stats do NOT affect Physical Dispersion and Gained as X Element, as they only increase the base elemental weapon damage.
- Due to changes to Ele Atk DMG, reworked Physical Dispersion a bit to implement a failsafe in case the player uses a physical spell. It will check the player's ele atk dmg stat instead.
- Physical Damage gained as X element now works similarly to Physical Dispersion. You gain the elemental damage at the end of the calculation now - it will also work on spells.
- Weapon Damage and Elemental Weapon Damage now properly apply after the fact.

Ocean Spell Changes:
- The following Ocean changes were implemented to give melee players more options when deciding to run Ocean.
- New Ocean Spell: Purity - provides yourself and nearby allies elemental resistances.
- New Ocean Spell: Arctic Armor - provides yourself with damage reduction at the expense of mana and energy regeneration.
- New Ocean Synergy (Arctic Armor): Rejuvenating Armor - while Arctic Armor is active, (all) hits have a chance of applying Cold Essence on self.
- New Ocean Attack Spell: Rime Blade - hits in an AOE in front of the user similar to Inferno Quake. Damage is converted to Frost. Using the spell also fires  frost projectiles in front of the caster, each dealing half the damage as spell damage.
- Ice Blade no longer provides Frost Attack Damage but rather Physical Damage Gained as Frost Damage.
- Ocean buffs have double in duration and the cooldown for them is now 10 seconds, more inline with other buff spells. I still want them to be shorter duration because my goal is for players to "manage" the Ocean buffs rather than setting it and leaving it. This is in part due to the sheer quantity of buffs Ocean has. These changes do not affect Frost Shield.
- Reduced the cast time to Frost Shield to be in line with the other Ocean buffs.
- Increased the cooldown of Frost Shield slightly.

Fire Spell Changes:
- Currently, Fire as a tree can be a bit uninteresting. It's essentially just raw damage. The new spell and summon aim to give Fire players a few more options when running with the tree. The summon aims to improve sustain, but requires the player to be near their summon, and Blazing Shell aims to give players a new defense option (stack armor).
- New Fire Summon Spell: Summon Archon - summon an archon that attacks enemies. Periodically, the summon will also recover nearby allies' mana. The base value of the mana recovered is the same as the summon's damage.
- New Fire Synergy (Summon Archon): Incendiary Touch - gives ALL summons a chance to deal AOE fire spell damage on attack.
- New Fire Spell: Blazing Shell - converts a portion of your armor into magic shield and also provides fire thorns.
- As a result of the above changes, Spell Blade no longer provides "Physical Damage Gained as Fire Damage" since it would no longer synergize with the Spell Blade synergy. Instead, it now provides "Physical Damage Converted to Fire Attack Damage" similar to how Poisoned Weapons works. This will result in a substantial reduction in Spell Blade damage, but was how the spell was originally meant to function.
- Due to the Spell Blade "nerf", Flame Blade has been buffed a bit to compensate.
- Fire Power now provides elemental spell damage instead of all spell damage.

Storm Spell Changes:
- Storm as a tree is currently problematic. The scaling potential it has is very high, while the floor is about the same as other trees. To tackle this problem, I first had to take a look at critical hits. The main issue was the critical damage stat, and as a result crit dmg has been reduced, while hits has retained its power more or less. Another issue with Storm was too much self-sufficiency. A lot of the spells scale with mana, and many of these spells are quite powerful. As a result, these spells had to be toned down a bit - most notably, Recharge. And lastly, this was actually overlooked on my part and never the intended outcome, but some synergies that triggered based on certain conditions were able to trigger themselves: Battery Fusilade synergy and the Surge synergies. The damage type for these has changed, so they will no longer be able to trigger almost infinitely.
- Chain Lightning no longer targets armor stands.
- Raised the floor but lowered the ceiling for Charged Sweep mana scaling.
- Lightning Totem now has a base tick rate of 20 instead of going from 40 -> 20.
- Lightning Totem radius now scales up to 4 by max level instead of 3.
- Lightning Totem can no longer fire multiple totems and is capped at 1.
- Lightning Totem base damage has doubled.
- Lightning Totem static synergy chance has been reduced at max level.
- Static Field cooldown has increased by 1 second.
- Static Field now deals 18% instead of 20% of remaining enemy health.
- Lowered Voltaic Blast chance and base damage slightly.
- Increased Stray Current base value slightly.
- Lightning Spear bolt synergy damage floor has increased but ceiling has decreased.
- Lowered the cost of Quick Charge slightly.
- Increased the mana cost of Recharge.
- Recharge duration is now a flat 60 seconds.
- Increased Lightning Dash cooldown by 20%.
- Lowered the critical hit chance from Critical Surge from 5% to 4%, but increased spell damage from 7% to 8% base.
- Increased lightning attack damage buff of Power Surge by about 30%.
- Lowered mana cost increase of Battery Fusilade's synergy slightly.
- Lowered Battery Fusilade's synergy's max level from 12 to 8.
- Increased Battery Fusilade's synergy's radius at lower levels.
- Battery Fusilade's synergy chance to trigger has been reduced, but now scales depending on how many Lightning Essence the caster currently has. At max stacks, the chance is higher than what it was before.
- Synergies of Battery Fusilade, Critical Surge, and Power Surge, as well as the Divine Judgment effect are now properly classified as "Bolt" damage types, similar to how Lightning Spear bolt synergy is classified. This means that these will not be modified by spell damage (elemental still works though). To make it more clear, these synergy and effect tooltips have been updated, and a lightning bolt sound and visual will be played when these trigger. Additionally, the synergies will no longer trigger themselves (eg. Voltaic Blast used to be able to trigger itself as long as the damage was a critical hit. Now, this is no longer possible).
- Voltaic Blast and Overload now deal their extra AOE damage to the target struck as well, instead of only nearby enemies.
- Static Discharge synergy has returned (synergy of Charged Sweep), which gives a chance to apply Static effect on hit.
- Charged Sweep no longer applies Static 100% of the time.

Nature Spell Changes:
- Nature's Armor no longer provides armor and instead provides a new stat: increased healing received.
- Lowered the attack scaling of Plague from 16% to 15% at max level.
- Changed Venom Load to give increased DoT damage as well as spell damage.

Divine Spell Changes:
- New Divine Spell: Blessing - bless yourself and your allies and increase your spell damage and mana on hit.
- New Divine Spell: Seethe - apply Enrage stacks on self. Higher levels apply more Enrage stacks.
- New Divine Spell: Angelic Raiment - increase the armor and dodge rating of yourself and nearby allies with this new buff.
- Changed Enrage to give affected targets percent increased damage taken and increased damage dealt, rather than lowering their armor and increasing their physical damage.
- Enrage movement speed buff has been lowered from 10% to 8%.
- Defend now gives 35% instead of 50% damage reduction at max level, and puts a 15% move speed debuff on the caster. I wanted to give Defend its own identity by being a "cast it in an emergency" spell. However, my last changes were a bit dramatic and I'm toning it down a bit.
- Changed Piercing Winds so that instead of lowering damage and cooldown, it does the opposite. It now increases damage at the expense of increasing cooldown.

Unholy Spell Changes:
- Increased Unholy Meditation heal values.
- Summon Zombie and Summon Skeletal Army no longer scale with weapon damage.
- Summon Zombie and Summon Skeletal Army base damage values have been increased tremendously to compensate for their lack of brains.

Hunting Spell Changes:
- Summon Hunting Wolf no longer has a base value and only scales with weapon damage. The rate at which it scales has been increased.

Summon Changes:
- Increased Summon HP slightly.
- Summons now move 33% faster.
- Tried to make summons more aggressive, they should now target everything but players, other summons/tamed, passive golems, and ageable entities. Please let me know if I've missed anything on the blacklist.
- Summons taunting on hit should be more consistent now, and can only occur every 3 seconds.
- Summon targeting AI now prioritizes mobs that hurt them > nearest mob > mobs that hurt the caster > mobs hurt by the caster, INSTEAD of mobs that hurt the caster > mobs hurt by the caster > mobs that hurt them > nearest mob. This should alleviate summons ganging up on a sole enemy (not prevent outright though). This will also give more functionality to Chilling Touch synergy.

Talent Changes:
- Lowered Increased Healing and Armor Penetration values on the talent tree.
- Replaced some talent nodes with Gauntlets weapon damage.
- Reduced the armor penalty of Avatar.
- Vampire gives a smaller multi on lifesteal now. The rest of it remains unchanged.
- Reduced Warlock DoT steal and DoT damage.
- Warlock penalty has been reduced from -25% to -20% health and magic shield.
- Added some sources of armor pen to the tree.
- Mana should no longer take damage when player has Mana Battery and a teammate hits them.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Craft to Exile Custom Uniques, Xaero's, Minecolonies, Mine and Slash.
- Added Force KeepInv.
- Removed Corpse Complex.

### Fixes
- Fixed quest book missing a quest line.
- Fixed missing unique: Wizardspike.
- Hopefully fixed a problem with losing inventory on death.
- Fixed an issue with item drops past level 100.

## [2.18.3] - 2022-08-15

### Updates
- Mobs should no longer randomly one shot players when using Enrage effect since it has been nerfed, and most mob sources of physical dispersion stat have been removed. Enrage was effectively doubling and sometimes tripling mob damage at max stats, and all of that physical damage was being converted to an element...
- Changed the mob affixes that gave physical dispersion and flat elemental damage to "mob gains xx% of physical damage as y element damage".
- Mob elemental affixes have been changed a bit. Resistance bonuses are generally higher and some penetration stats have been moved around.
- Increased armor penetration on mob affixes.

### Mine and Slash Updates
- Nature's Avatar has been reworked and renamed to just Avatar. Instead of converting everything into nature damage, it now gives Physical Dispersion, dodge, and some penalties to health and armor.
- Increased the spell damage penalty on Pacifist.
- Cleaned up some tooltip stuff for Berserker's Impartiality and Reckless Blows.
- Reduced the defensive penalty of Reckless Blows.
- Lowered innate mob resistances.
- Increased damage reduction from Defend from 25% to 50%.
- Significantly increased Defend's cooldown.
- Block now costs energy ONLY when actively blocking (regardless of fail or success). Currently, blocking is too strong and a bit braindead. By incorporating energy cost, players will have to actively balance their energy and think about when they should actually block.
- Thorns no longer drains energy.
- Fixed an issue where effects such as burn and plague were capped at over-level 13 instead of 16.
- Sources of block chance have been reduced. It's still easy to hit cap but will require a bit more investment.
- Vitality now provides about 33% less energy regen than it did previously.
- Lowered elemental attack damage map mob affix to about 18% of what it was before.
- Enrage now gives half as much physical damage as it did previously.
- Removed the map affix that adds mob elemental attack damage and physical dispersion.
- Replaced the above map affix with one that gives "gain xx% of physical damage as 'insert element'al damage".
- Added a new all elemental penetration map affix for mobs.
- Added a new health regen map affix for mobs.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Mine and Slash.

### Fixes
- Fixed a bug regarding EXP share and the level penalty.
- Fixed a bug where Purifying Flames judgment synergy required the mob to already have at least one stack of judgment before applying judgment. This is no longer the case.
- Fixed a bug where Bleed was actually doing 8% of your phys instead of 10% like it says in the tooltip.
- Fixed some mislabelled health and magic shield costs in the spell tooltips showing double what they should have.

## [2.18.2] - 2022-08-13

### Updates
- Talent and spell reset potions have been provided for this update.
- Improved quest text regarding plants in agate forests in the Gaia dim.
- Voltaxic Rift, Nuro's Harp, and Ngamahu's Flame have had some stats changed.

### Mine and Slash Updates
- Changed how weapon damage stat and elemental weapon damage stat work. Before, they would check if the damage effect had the same weapon type as the stat. However, most damage sources such as spells don't have an explicit weapon type. So these weapon damage stats would only apply to basic attacks. I've changed it so that it applies as long as the damage effect is of the attack type (basic attacks, attack spells, summon attacks), AND if the player is holding a weapon of the same type. Eg. if you're holding a bow, anytime you perform an attack, you will get your bow weapon damage bonus applied.
- Lowered Talent weapon damage node values from 8% to 6%. Elemental weapon damage remains the same. I kept increasing it slowly over time thinking that it wasn't good enough, turns out it just never worked as intended. It would be way overtuned (probably) if I didn't reduce it again.
- Reduced some mob stats slightly.
- Increased base mob damage.
- Reduced Rock Slide damage.
- Increased intensity of map affixes.
- Mobs no longer have built-in armor penetration and elemental penetration.
- Swords no longer require luck and instead require vitality.
- Hammers no longer require vitality and instead require more strength.
- Attack scaling of all attack spells has decreased due to the weapon damage stat fix.
- Physical damage talent nodes have been reduced in effectiveness.
- Spell Blade no longer converts 100% phys to fire damage at max level but 60% instead.
- Bleed duration has increased from 5 to 7s.
- Defend gives less 25% less armor than previously.
- Resourceful trait now gives a -multi rather than a +multi.
- Familiar Instincts now gives a -25 multi to HP regen rather than 40.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Mine and Slash, Craft to Exile Custom Uniques.

### Fixes
- Fixed a bug where Bone Squall cost 60% health at level 1 instead of 6%.
- Hopefully fixed an issue where spell-casting mobs were doing ridiculous amounts of damage.

## [2.18.1b] - 2022-08-13

### Updates
- Tier scaling has been readjusted so that the ceiling is lower by about 25%.
- Mob health has been reduced by about 9% across the board.

### Mine and Slash Updates
- Reduced mob HP and damage ceiling in regards to mob rarity. In general, higher rarity mobs will deal less damage.
- Increased mob armor and resist stats.
- Increased base mob damage. Even lower rarity mobs should pack a punch.
- Plague duration has been reduced significantly.
- Plague attack scaling per level has been reduced by about 12.5% from its previous value (18% > 16%).
- Plague base value per level has been increased by 33% from its previous value.
- Burn duration and base value has increased.
- Reduced projectile count and scaling of Retribution.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Mine and Slash.

### Fixes
- Fixed a bug where Martyrdom was costing 80% health instead of 8%.

## [2.18.1] - 2022-08-12

### Updates
- Mob scaling has been changed so that they're substantially more difficult early game, but slightly easier past level 80.
- Tier's mob HP and damage bonuses have been changed so higher tiered mobs have slightly less HP than previously, but more damage.
- Uncommon and above mobs were appearing far too frequently, there was like a 50% chance a mob would be more than weak. I have adjusted the weighting so that it's about a 15% chance that a mob would be more than weak.

### Mine and Slash Updates
- Team Dungeons now also provide players with a large bonus to Unique Item drops.
- Changed mob scaling so mobs are much stronger at lower-mid levels, but slightly easier at higher levels.
- Weak mobs have had their power increased by 9%.
- Mob stats that were not scaling properly have been increased by a bit.
- Mob stat rarity scaling has been reduced from uncommon to champion rarity substantially.
- EXP has been shifted from higher rarity mobs to lower rarity mobs.
- Increased attack scaling of Hunting spells substantially.
- Enrage now applies a taunt to enemies every tick. This means Martyrdom and Whirlwind have the potential of taunting enemies as well.
- Increased the mana and energy cost of Retribution.
- Retribution attack scaling has been reduced.
- Martyrdom now costs health to use. Its mana and energy costs have been reduced.
- Martyrdom health scaling has been reduced.
- Provoke is now an instant cast spell.

- Updated Mine and Slash.

### Fixes
- Fixed an issue where some mob stats were not scaling with their level properly (reists, elemental penetration, armor penetration).
- Fixed an issue where non-map worlds had tiers but the tier stat bonuses weren't applying to mobs. This should make progression past the Nether more difficult.
- Fixed Malevolent Offering synergy localization and some other missing localization.
- Fixed missing set localization.
- Fixed missing River Beehive recipe.
- Fixed some quest text being misleading.
- Potentially fixed some Lyca mob spawns?
- Fixed Retribution not actually being shorter lasting.

## [2.18.0b] - 2022-08-11

- Reduced the base value and scaling of some of the summon spells.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Mine and Slash.

## [2.18.0] - 2022-08-11

### Updates
- Xaero's Update Alert: back up your Xaero's Waypoints and WorldMap folders!
- Reset potions have been provided for this update due to the substantial changes to them.
- Hungers no longer drop Void Hearts.
- Blocking with shields no longer has a 5 tick delay.
- Disabled Rebounding enchantment.

### Mine and Slash Updates
Core Stat Changes:
- Core stats have been reworked a bit. Some stats have been shifted around. The main issue was "magic casters" were able to easily funnel their point into Intelligence and get defense, damage, and sustain consistently, whereas melee and especially ranged were forced to spread over at least 2-3 different stats. Hopefully, the changes below will make it more necessary for spell casters to invest in Wisdom, while still retaining some of their high burst potential. The idea was that spell caster stats would be Int/Wis, melee would be Vit/Str, and ranged would be Dex/Vit. Additionally, a 3rd "flex" stat that any build could use has replaced Stamina.
- Vitality now provides health, health regen, and energy regen instead of health and armor. The health regen it provides is 33% less than what it used to provide when it was on Stamina.
- Strength now provides phys damage percent, armor, and flat energy instead of phys damage percent and crit damage. The flat energy it provides is 33% less than what it used to provide when it was on stamina (it is now available on two diff stats now).
- Intelligence still provides the same ele spell dmg, magic shield percent, and mana, but now provides 33% less mana.
- Wisdom still provides the same increased healing, magic shield regen, and mana regen, but now provides 33% more magic shield regen, and 50% more increased healing.
- Dexterity now provides dodge, energy, and bow/crossbow damage, instead of dodge, crit hit, and armor pen. The energy it provides is equivalent to what Strength provides per point. The idea for this stat was to be beneficial mainly for ranged damage dealers, but stay as just an option for them. If they want to run dodge, they get rewarded with more damage specific to bows/xbows. However, they can still run strength instead if they want to opt for armor.
- Stamina has been renamed "Luck" and now provides some dodge and critical hit and damage. The crit damage it provides is 50% more than what it used to provide on Strength.
- The changes to energy on dexterity, strength and vitality should make it easier to upkeep energy.

Talent Changes:
- New Talent: Nature's Avatar - half of non-nature damage is converted into nature damage. Deal no non-nature damage. Also increases all nature damage and nature resistances a bit.
- New Talent: Shulker Shell - 60% of damage received is converted into physical damage. Also lowers armor and elemental resists.
- New Talent: Conjurer - increases summon damage substantially and provides cooldown reduction but deal substantially less spell damage.
- New Talent: Trickster - critical hits have a 25% chance of giving self a power charge (max of 3) for 6s. Each power charge gives 30% flat critical damage. Hopefully this talent makes critical builds a little more engaging and rewarding.
- New Talent: Overseer - attacks have a 50% chance of giving self a fortitude charge (max of 3) for 8s. Each fortitude charge gives 4% damage reduction. Hopefully this talent makes attack/tanky builds more engaging to play.
- New Talent: Pocket Capacitor - increases magic shield regen substantially, but makes it so you cannot life or spell steal.
- New Talent: Resourceful - use energy instead of mana when casting spells with a mana cost. Spells with mana and energy costs will just combine the two.
- The talent tree has been expanded! An additional "ring" that's generally easier to traverse across has been added. Most of the new talents listed above can be found in this ring.
- Harmony now reduces effectiveness of heals to 67% instead of 50%.
- Reduced the amount of flat life and spellsteal from Vampire by a third.

Spell Changes:
- New Nature Spell: Venom Load - applies an effect on caster that deals nature damage to self based on a percentage of their maximum health every half second. It also deals AOE nature damage equal to double the damage dealt to self every half second to nearby enemies. The effect/buff? also provides the caster with substantial flat spell damage.
- New Hunting (Summon Hunting Wolf) Synergy: Sharpened Fangs - causes ALL summons to have a chance of applying Wounds.
- Health and magic shield costs now display the percent and the actual value next to it in brackets.
- Improved spell tooltip hint about holding shift.

### Updates

- The Party section of the Dissonance Wiki, under 'First Steps', has been updated.

### Mine and Slash Updates
- EXP level penalty is now determined on an individual basis when in a party, instead of based on the killer. This means a level 50 partying with a level 20 will no longer grant the full experience to the level 20 when killing a level 50 mob. Instead, if the level 50 wishes to power level the level 20, they can kill level 20 mobs. This should prevent excessive power leveling (still possible, just a lot slower).
- Party EXP boost is now capped at 6 players. Eg. party of 2, you get 120% of the exp divided by 2, so each player gets 60%. At a party of 6, you will get 200% exp, divided by 6. At a party of 7, you will still only get 200% exp.
- Party share only applies to members within 100 blocks of the killer and within the same dimension.
- The following changes were made to bring the runes more up to date with newer and a larger variety of stats. No more two runes providing the same stats!
- Oni unique rune now gives +1 All Skills instead of flat armor.

- Goh rune now gives elemental thorns instead of percent spell damage on the jewelry slot.
- Rah rune now gives elemental attack damage percent instead of elemental penetration percent on the armor slot.
- Dos rune now gives armor penetration instead of elemental penetration on the armor slot.
- Readjusted some resource (HP, Magic Shield, Mana, etc.) values across the board. There should overall be a 10-20% lower ceiling.
- Reduced effectiveness of elemental penetration and elemental spell damage flat stats by about 33%.
- Shifted some stats around in the Stat Info window.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Mine and Slash.

### Fixes

- Fixed block not working as intended.
- Fixed a problem where stats that gave bonuses to all elements (eg. all elemental spell damage) would actually make elemental resist apply to that stat. So if you had 1% all elemental spell damage and 25% all elemental resist, you would end up with 25% all elemental spell damage and 25% all elemental resist... Oops.
- Fixed Life Siphon being triggerable off of allies and summons.

## [2.16.1] - 2022-07-24

- Lowered currency drop rates by 20%.
- Mob strength scaling has been increased, mobs will be more difficult at higher levels.
- Mob health has been increased by 10% across the board.
- Call to Arms cooldown reduction has been toned down a bit.

### Mine and Slash Updates
Spell Changes:
- The following changes to were mostly to aid spells that were slightly underperforming. Additionally, spells with long cast times that had effects during the cast times have had their cooldown reduced drastically, as they didn't actually come off cooldown until the spell completed casting.
- Chilling Field scales from 6% to 12% max mana and 3 to 6 base value insead of 4% to 12% max mana and 2 to 6 base value.

Chaos/Arcana Stat Changes:
- Changes to Chaos and Arcana stats should see improvements across the board, giving a greater variety of stats. In general, there are less negative stats now, and the negative effects are lessened. The idea was to lessen the "risk" part of high risk/high reward, so that it's now medium risk/high reward. Increased chance in legendary drop rates and drop improvements in higher tiered maps should also make it easier for players to find good items.
- Buffed some Chaos stats. Barbarian and Clumsy Scholar have less of a penalty now.
- Negative Chaos stat effects are much less punishing now.
- Earth, Fire, Frost, and Thunder Atronach chaos stats now additionally grant Increased Duration, Projectile Speed, Cooldown Reduction, and Area of Effect, respectively.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Mine and Slash.

### Fixes
- Fixed heal power/increased healing only affecting incoming heals and taking the stat of the receiver instead of the caster. It should now work as intended.

## [2.16.0c] - 2022-07-21

### Mine and Slash Updates
Mob Changes:
- Mobs can now cast some basic spells. Most of them are "on hit", whether they're hit or they cause the hit.
- Cold, Flaming, Lightning, Venomous, and Sanguine mob affixes have been changed to be spell oriented. They also will say "caster" in their names to better denote the change.
- Frost Nova Spell - When mob deals damage, send out a nova of ice from the target that deals damage around them in AOE. The spell also applies a 33% slow for 3s.
- Flame Sweep Spell - When mob deals damage, spew forth flames in front of them to damage in AOE.

### Mine and Slash Updates
- Buffed Divine aura buffs substantially. My goal was to make the buffs more relevant and sought out in parties. Eg. change from ele spell dmg to cdr should make it more useful in groups:
- Bravery now gives substantial amounts of Vitality, Strength, Health Regen, and Block Chance instead of small amounts of Health, Block Chance, and Strength.
- Trickery now gives substantial amounts of Dexterity, Stamina, Energy Regen, and Critical Hit Chance instead of small amounts of Critical Hit Chance, Energy Regen, and Dexterity.
- Wizardry now gives substantial amounts of Intelligence, Wisdom, Mana Regen, and Cooldown Reduction instead of small amounts of Elemental Spell Damage, Mana Regen, and Intelligence.
- Buffed Poison Ball by increasing its base value damage by max level by 20%, and attack scaling values by about 10% across the board.
- Buffed Rock Slide by increasing its base value damage by 50% and doubling the attack scaling values.
- Reduced the cooldown of Gorgon's Gaze substantially. At max level it is now 12 seconds instead of 18 seconds.
- Reduced the mana cost of Nature's Balm by about 25%.
- Reduced the mana cost of Thorny Armor by about 40%.
- Reduced the mana cost of the Nature Curses by about 20%.
- The max level of the Nature Curses has been increased from 4 to 6. They have been greatly buffed, but it will require just a few more points of investment to make the most out of them.
- Corrosion now reduces armor and dodge rating at a base rate of 500, up from 150, and reduces movement speed by 15%, up from 10%.
- Quietus (Mortality Sap Curse) now reduces flat physical damage and a very very substantial amount of health regen instead of critical hit chance and damage. Crit values were non-scaling and were not very impactful.
- Mind Rot now reduces magic shield at a base rate of 100, up from 25, mana regen by 50, up from 5, and elemental resists by 33%, up from 15%.

- Fixed an issue where traps weren't lasting their entire duration.
- Traps now require at least 1 second of "preparation" before activating. Basically, they need to be one the ground for at least a second before they explode. This should make it easier to hit more than one enemy now instead of the trap exploding immediately upon contact. This will be a small nerf to Cluster Traps, but I think it's a bit needed given how powerful Cluster Traps was in cramped settings.
- Traps can no longer explode in the air.
- Trap durations have all been changed to a flat 10s.
- Snare Trap now deals damage on top of snaring enemies.
- Snare Trap AOE now goes from 1.5 -> 3.5 instead of 1 -> 3.

- Reduced Bleed damage by 20%, and duration from 6s to 5s.
- Hopefully fixed a rare NPE for summoned creatures.

- Removed Ruins structures from Atum since they caused crashes.

## [2.15.0] - 2022-02-07

### General Updates
- Xaero's Update Alert: back up your Xaero's Waypoints and WorldMap folders!
- TWO new Patreon-designed unique items! Thanks to Nozium and Balloonatic!!! Also a special thanks to Soul for making the textures! The items are listed below.
- Unburstable Balloon Sword - a unique frost OR lightning-based sword with magic finding and a huge bonus to the Tidal Wave OR Charged Sweep spell.
- Titanium Dreadnaughts - a unique armor with bonuses to health and divine spells. This armor is very defensive!
- Dimensional Dungeon loot tables have been changed a bit. I've included very few but some technology items in the loot tables. Additionally, low-level items such as iron swords, diamond swords, etc. have been replaced with higher level items such as items you might find in the Gaia dimension. This doesn't prevent all low level items from appearing in these chests however, as Dim Dungeons sometimes uses vanilla loot tables.
- Many quests involving the Lycanites Mobs have been either removed, reworked, or moved to different dimensions.
- Increased Minecolonist's damage by 10x. It's probably still going to be absymally low but may help a bit with the guards.

- Lightning Spear damage has been reduced by about 9%.
- Lightning Totem chance to apply Static has been reduced.
- Lowered chance to apply Static from Charged Nova from 90% -> 80%.
- Mobs now have built in health regen (a low amount).

## [2.14.4] - 2022-01-06

### Updates
- Changes to Block (listed below) should allow it to be a more viable defensive option while not changing it for players who enjoy how it currently works.
- New shield thorns stats have been added from level 1-50.
- New shield physical thorn stats have been added.
- Reenabled the Tropicraft sifter.

### Mine and Slash Updates
- Blocking has been reworked. You can now PASSIVELY BLOCK without holding up your shield (needs to be in offhand still). Upon a successful passive block, reduce damage by 25%. You can also still ACTIVELY (hold up the shield) block. When actively blocking, your block chance is DOUBLED (capped at 75).
- If you're actively blocking and you successfully block, reduce damage by 100%, otherwise if you fail, you still get to reduce it by 50% (same as before).
- Decreased effectiveness of Block Chance stats substantially (by about 60%). Since you can double your block chance by actively blocking, this shouldn't really affect players who were used to the previous style of blocking.
- Shield can now also roll elemental resist as a secondary stat.
- Thorns stat has been buffed by about 25%.
- Thorns stat now reflects additional damage if holding up a shield. Upon a successful block, reflect 50% more damage back, and upon an unsuccessful block, still reflect 10% more damage back. The tooltip has been updated to reflect this.
- Orbs and Torches can also roll elemental resist as a secondary stat, but at half effectiveness of what shields can roll.
- Improved tooltip for blocking and thorns.
- Nature Armor now provides a substantial amount of Nature Thorns (the reflect damage kind).
- Increased Defend's Physical Thorns by 100%.
- Changed Heal Power tooltip for now until I manage to fix increased healing...
- Lightning Spear Lightning Strike synergy damage has been reduced by about 40-50%. The previous damage values were unintended and were designed around the synergy requiring 8 points instead of the current 4. For the amount of points required, the synergy was far too strong.
- Lightning Spear damage has been reduced by about 9%.
- Lightning Totem chance to apply Static has been reduced.

### Mod Updates

- Fireballs now explode upon contact and deal AOE damage.
- Lightning Spear has been reworked and now fires a piercing projectile. It functions similarly to Ice Bolt but goes further. The below changes were made to keep it in line with the power of the other projectiles. It's still stronger than before.

- Lightning Spear no longer gives the caster a movement speed boost upon hitting the enemy.

- Reduced the radius of the hammer's AOE very slightly.
- Reduced energy cost of daggers by about 20%.
- Lowered the attack speed of hammers.

- Reworked Lightning Dash to give a large boost to movement speed for a short duration instead of "dashing" you.
- Energy Dash synergy no longer exists.

## [2.14.1b] - 2021-12-13

### Updates
- Xaero's Update Alert: back up your Xaero's Waypoints and WorldMap folders!
- Due to the changes to the spell tree, everyone has been provided with a spell reset potion!

### Mine and Slash Updates
- Spell Changes:
- Increased "gain" per level for a spell. This means each point in a spell will provide more damage, scaling, mana cost, etc. than before. This applies to ALL spells and synergies! In general, spells with lower max levels will scale at a greater rate. This may throw balance out the window a bit so things will probably change in the future. You will notice a lot of the cooldowns will be lower as a result, too.
- Reduced the mana cost of many spells (mostly spells and not attack spells).
- Increased the base damage of most non-attack spell spells. About 20% increases at higher levels. This should help spell casters at higher levels and make investing points in a skill more rewarding.
- Buffed literally every (except maybe one) Synergy. All "chance to x" synergies have had their chances increased, etc. Storm probably sees the biggest buff from this.
- Increased mana scaling of Chilling Field by 25% at higher levels.
- Magic Burst mana cost no longer increases as it levels. Instead, the magic shield cost increases, but damage has been increased to compensate.
- Slightly reduced mana cost of Blizzard.
- Fixed a bug where Battery Fusilade projectiles were sometimes affected by gravity.
- Increased health scaling of Martyrdom and some Unholy spells.
- Increased armor scaling of Retribution.
- Increased physical attack scaling of Purifying Fires at higher levels.
- Increased physical attack scaling of Whirlwind at higher levels slightly.
- Spear of Judgment can be learnt at level 20 instead of 40.
- Increased damage of Spear of Judgment.
- New Synergy (Spear of Judgment) - Enlightenment: successful hits restore mana to the user and nearby allies.
- Thorny Bush radius no longer scales with level.
- Increased Thorny Bush damage by about 40%.
- Rock Slide has changed to a classic "storm" spell this is mostly so that it can function still in lower-ceiling areas.
- Reduced damage of Rock Slide and the synergy since having it as a proper storm spell increases the consistency.
- Reduced Rock Slide tick rate.
- Rock Slide now gains radius as it levels.
- Increased magic shield scaling of Soul Shred.
- Lowered the height and variability at which stones and arrows spawn for Rock Slide and Arrow Storm. This should help Arrow Storm but probably still won't help with 2 block-high ceilings.
- New Level 10 Hunting Spell - Arrow Totem: summon a totem that fires an arrow at the nearest enemy!
- Fixed Recoil of the Hunter having a max level of 8. Should be 1.
- Fixed some incorrect Nature Mastery localization.
- Fixed a bug where synergies had incorrect max levels. You will notice a bunch of them have changed - these were the intended values.
- Fixed a bug where a lot of the spell sounds weren't playing properly.
- Improved the sounds of some of the spells to make them feel more responsive.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Xaero's, Mine and Slash.

## [2.14.0] - 2021-12-11

### Updates
- Due to the changes to the Nature tree, everyone has been provided with a spell reset potion!
- A change to Nature spells is outlined below in the Mine and Slash Updates section. Overall, there is an emphasis on keeping the Plague effect (formerly known as Thorns) on mobs.
- Quests have been restructured to make progression feel a bit more open-ended. I've basically reduced the amount of linearity and turned previously "mandatory" quests into optional ones. Note: I changed a lot of the quest dependencies so you may have some holes in your quest lines.
- In general, any time a quest looks like it requires more than one dependency it only actually requires one. If it requires more, the quest will state it.
- Act I quests have been shifted to be more open. Quest EXP values have been moved around as well.
- Act II's Light In The Shadows now requires 1 Nether Star instead of 3, and does not require both the Black Death and Warts quests (just needs 1 of them).
- Act IV's "Followers Of Atum" now only requires one of two dependencies to unlock.
- Act V's "Negative Karma" now only requires 2 Negatite Gems instead of 4.
- Act VIb's "Purification" now only requires two of four dependencies instead of three of four to unlock.
- Act VII's kill quests have been restructured greatly. There are now multiple avenues to get to the last boss quest (Guardian Of The Stone), and a lot of the previously mandatory quests are now side quests.
- Added some tips on how to find the Markuzuar Plant in that one quest.
- Act VII's "Double Rainbow" now only requires one of two dependencies to unlock.
- Act VII's "Guardian Of The Stone" now only requires one of two dependencies to unlock.

- Rock Slide has been buffed and is now more appropriate as an "ultimate".
- Rock Slide synergy Stone Shrapnel is now Virulent Shrapnel and causes Rock Slide to deal much more damage if the target is affected by at least 6 stacks of Thorns.
- Other Spells:
- Ice Bolt now travels faster and pierces enemies, but deals slightly less damage. It also costs slightly less mana.
- Renamed:
- Thorns has been renamed to Plague. A bunch of Nature spells have been renamed to reflect this change.
- Hunter Instinct has been renamed to Hunter's Instinct.
- Chilled has been renamed to Chill.
- Fixed:
- Nature Synergy dealing extra damage when target had Thorns effect no longer removes a stack of Thorns (mistake).

- Mob affix weighting has been shifted, in general, the elemental affixes have lower weight now.
- Mob affixes have been rebalanced. Before, running into an elemental affix meant certain doom. This is because some of them would literally deal an ADDITIONAL 100% of their physical damage as an element. this has been changed. See the mob affixes in detail on the wiki.
- Mobs scale at a higher rate now, and should reach 3x strength by level 90 instead of 100. This is more impactful past level 70, and barely affects levels 1-70.
- 3 new level 101-120 sets! These 3 new sets fit an archetype and are pretty powerful/rare!
- Some level 70+ sets have been buffed.

### Mine and Slash Updates
- 2 new weapon types: Daggers, and Wands.
- Daggers are fast attacking critical-based melee weapons.
- Wands are like staves, but specialize more in healing and utility stats. Also, wands can only roll physical damage as a primary stat. They are also faster attacking.
- Staves no long roll increase healing as a secondary stat and can now roll faster cast rate instead.
- "Rare" mobs (which were actually uncommon) have been renamed to "Adept" to prevent confusion.
- Experience required to level up past 100 scales significantly faster than 1-100.
- There is a new EXP multiplier config in the dimension config.
- Fixed a bug where instead of giving a 20% bonus chance for map drops while in a map, it was actually a -80% chance... Map sustain should be much more bearable after this fix!
- Chaotic Wisp now has an additional 25% chance to break your item instead of 20%.
- Reduced the power of Chaos and Major Arcana stats. In general, there are less positive "multis". These stats were meant to be risky to apply, but currently they're too strong and low-risk. The change above also reflects this.
- Some Spell Changes:
- Almost all cooldowns have been reduced greatly, this is an aRPG not an MMORPG! Notably, storm spells have been reduced the most. Buffs remained almost unchanged.
- All spells now have a minimum of 1 second cast time except Attack Spells, "basic/ball" spells, Nature's curses, movement spells, and the Hunting Potion.
- Summon Zombie and Summon Wolf cooldowns no longer change with level. Zombie cooldown is now 30 (buff), and wolf's cooldown is 45 (nerf).
- Duration for the following spells is now unchanging per level and has been set to what it would be "maxed": Holy Flower, Magma Flower, Steam Cloud, Volcano, Arrow Storm, Thorn Bush, Blizzard, Chilling Field, Whirlpool, Thunderstorm, Blight, Hellfire Cloak, Soul Shred.
- Given that the above changes will probably drain your mana and energy at even quicker rates, reduced the rate at which mana and energy cost (not health) increases per level. In some cases before, the mana/energy cost would double by max level. Now, they'll only cost 50% more than the level 1 cost.
- Some spells have had their initial costs reduced as well.
- Lightning spells have relatively higher mana costs than other masteries, but lower cooldowns.
- Fire spells have relatively higher damage than other masteries, but have higher cooldowns.
- Reduced scaling of Purifying Fires slightly.
- Fixed runes giving twice the stats they were supposed to give.
- New stat: Damage Reduction which reduces damage by a percent. At the moment, only one Major Arcana trait uses it.
- Cooldown reduction stat has been lowered in power slightly.
- Improved shield tooltips when holding shift.

- Dimension Dungeon's chests now have a guaranteed chance to roll 1-3 of the following loot crates: weapon, armor, jewelry, rune, currency, map, legendary, and unique. The level at which they appear ranges from 70-100, and depends on the dungeon's difficulty.
- Also I'm pretty sure I mention it twice below in fixes and M&S updates, but Dimension Dungeons drop pool actually works now. Get those high tier uniques from mobs!
- A new quest showcasing the new Identification Tome which can identify your entire inventory at once. Say no to carpal tunnel!
- The following changes are to hopefully aid mid-game ranged and spellcasters to be a little more in line with melee.
- New craftable unique staff: Spire of Lazarus. This unique goes from level 31-40, and has a 30% chance of rolling as the Spire of Lazarus unique when crafted.
- Neptunium Bows now have a 20% chance of rolling as the Silverbranch unique bow.
- The Lore runeword (Goh, Ano) now provides high mana regen and high energy regen stats instead of energy regen and lightning resistances.
- Chaber Cairn (and therefore the Arachnon Hammer) has had its flat physical damage scaled down (relatively), but the percent physical damage increased.
- The Arachnon Hammer now rolls from Lv. 16-40, instead of 1-35. The early game power from the hammer was just too much, making melee far too strong early-game.
- The chance of rolling a unique when crafting an Arachnon Hammer has been lowered from 25% to 15%.
- 3 new quests in chapter III (The End) which highlight the craftable uniques.
- Unique weapons' base damage have been balanced across the board to keep the primary damage stat more in line with what "regular" items can roll. In general, this is a buff for hammers.
- Shulkers now drop 2 shells.
- Player heads are now dropped when killed by another player.
- Player stats are now tracked (such as time played)! Useful for servers. To see what stats are tracked, check /scoreboard objectives setdisplay sidebar ...!
- Lowered the sound of Aegis greatly. They were too obnoxious in villages.
- EXP and durability penalties upon death has been decreased from 33% loss to 25%.

### Mine and Slash Updates
- Reworked primary stats of armors. Plate and leather no longer give HP as a primary stat, this has been moved to the secondary stats. All armors now give 1.5x rate of their main stat (plate = armor, etc.), or 1x rate of their main stat and 0.75x rate of another defensive stat (plate = 1x armor + 0.75x magic shield, etc.). This should improve diversity by allowing players to spec into two defensive options and not feel forced to go into just one.
- Secondary stat of armors has also been reworked. You can no longer get raw "core stats" from secondary stats (vit, dex, etc.). Secondary stats now are more specific to the armor type, and all armors can roll HP (plate rolls the highest, cloth and leather tied). Added some more useful stats to secondary stat pools for armors, but also added 2 junk stats to offset it.
- Armors have been re-textured to look 100x nicer.
- FINALLY FIXED a long-standing bug where dimensions with tiers were given a tier of 0 instead of the tier they were set to.
- Loot crate scores are now hidden since they don't do anything.
- Renamed and retextured the old Identification Tome to Identification Scroll.
- Added a new item: Identification Tome - identifies your entire inventory at once. The recipe for making this consists of scrolls, an ore, and leather.
- Changed stat scaling to be more linear from level 1-50, spiking from that point on and capping at level 70. Before, it spiked at level 30/40 and capped out too early.
- Weapon damage scaling has been toned down. Previously, weapon scaling would be almost 50% more than that of spells and other stats. Now, it should be roughly the same.
- In general, you will feel weaker, but scaling should be more balanced between the play styles. Keep in mind that mobs will also scale slower too.
- Decreased Mine and Slash sword attack speed to be more in line with vanilla swords.
- Decreased Mine and Slash axe and staff attack speed to be more in line with vanilla axes.
- Increased hammer energy consumption by 10%.
- Staves now can roll pure elemental attack damage rather than physical + elemental.
- Stat requirements for weapon types have been changed slightly. In general, stat requirements have been increased. The general trend for stat requirements is that each weapon type has a "main" stat, and a "secondary" stat. Secondary stat requirements are almost negligible. You may require a respec!

### Updates
- Xaero's Update Alert: back up your Xaero's Waypoints and WorldMap folders!

### Fixes
- Fixed Mjolner and Cospri's Malice having incorrect stats.

## [2.12.0] - 2021-07-18

### Updates
- Xaero's Update Alert: back up your Xaero's Waypoints and WorldMap folders!
- 2 new PATREON-designed uniques! The first, Ad Nozium, by Nozium: this new summoner's necklace is the first and currently ONLY item in the game that grants the increased duration stat. The second, Sword of Occultos, by Occultos: a fantastic lightning + physical damage sword which increases the power of your summons - what a unique combination... What builds will come from this one?!
- If you want to design your own set, runeword, or unique item, check out my Patreon!
- Upon initially logging in, you are now invulnerable for 2 minutes rather than only 15 seconds. This effect only applies if you stay nearly still (aka when logging in).
- Migrated pretty much all script recipes/tags into datapacks. This was necessary because sometimes scripts would require a reload (they didn't load upon server/world start), meaning if players didn't reload the script, then half the custom recipes would not apply. This should also improve world load up times a bit.
- Slight affix changes. Infusion stat should be almost impossible to find now on stats, and has been replaced by increase elemental attack damage stats. Other things have changed too, but mostly this is in preparation for a huge affix update coming up next, which will bring the current count of ~120 affixes to over 350. The update will also give certain item types more identity, like cloth armor giving less armor stats, shields no longer giving spell damage, and more thoughtful affixes, such as dual-element affixes, etc. There will also be "tiers" of affixes, so instead of trying to find the same affix from level 1-100, new (and better) affixes will be introduced into the affix pool. This will make the early game a little more difficult as the affixes are generally going to be weaker than before. By level 50, affixes will be roughly same same power as currently, but also keep in mind items are more focused so it will be easier to gear up. Note: the affix update will take a while as basically the entire affix system is being overhauled, just wanted to give everyone a heads up that big changes are coming.
- Reduced spawn rate of Swampy, Frostbitten, Burned, and Eskimos.
- There are now more milestones in the upper end of Slice of Life, meaning you can get more hearts from it total. So instead of going from 300, 350, 400, it's now 300, 325, 350, ... etc.
- Slice of Life milestones now provide twice as many hearts than previously. You may need to reset your SoL progress to take advantage of this, I'm not sure. I know there's a command for it though.
- Players have received spell and talent reset potions.
- Reduced overall EXP gain rate by ~25%. With recent changes to maps and other mobs, EXP was being gained very, very quickly.
- Withers, Ender Dragons, Thunder all don't play globally anymore.
- Disabled Curse of Binding to the best of my ability.
- Some previously "disabled" enchants that were still obtainable through rare methods should be even rarer.
- Some unique items have had their stat requirements adjusted.
- Some uniques with elemental focus stats have had them replaced (mostly).

### Mine and Slash Updates
Talent Tree Rehaul:
- Basically the entire tree has been remade. The pathing choices should be a lot more interesting, and lots of paths branch to improve pathing. For instance, the mage (top) section no longer contains 4 huge node wheels, 1 for each element, and instead has one small section for all elements. The rest of the space is used for other new stats that have been slowly introduced over the past few updates.
- General ideas for the tree now: nodes and clusters closer to the start point are more "general/all-encompassing" than previously. Like mentioned above, more "spell damage" vs. "fire spell damage/water spell damage". As you go further from the center, the clusters become more specific. I think the bottom quadrant was most culprit to this, having only specific weapon damage nodes at the start.
- Left side has been rebranded to be more summon/support heavy. It still retains a lot of block chance, elemental resists, etc. In fact, it no longer gives infusion stats but straight up elemental attack damage percent increases.
- The starting regions have been heavily changed.
- The tree now has Increased Area of Effect, Increased Duration, and Increased Projectile Speed nodes.
- Spell Power and Elemental Spell-related nodes have been reduced in power a bit.
- Bleed Mastery now gives a -15% damage multi to physical damage and -25% damage multi to elemental.
- Bleed has been changed to have max 20 stacks instead of 8, but deals 10% of your physical attack damage per stack instead of 25%.
- Blood Mage and Overflowing Vitality have swapped positions.
- Fortified Reaction now gives a -10% armor multi instead of -20%.
- Fortified Reaction, Reckless Blows, and Steady Hand have moved.
- Ruthless and Warlock have been toned down in power.
- Physical damage and DoT nodes have been reduced in effectiveness a bit.
- Weapon damage nodes (non-elemental) have been buffed.

New Spells/Synergies:
- New Level 5 Storm Spell: Electrical Discharge - deal 20% of nearby enemies' CURRENT effective health (includes magic shield) as lightning damage. Points into this spell reduce its cooldown, mana cost, and increase its range. This spells damage can be modified by increases to spell damage, etc.
- New Electrical Discharge Synergy: Static Field - hits have a chance to apply Lightning Essence stacks on the user. Remember, this thing hits multiple enemies!
- New Level 10 Storm Spell: Recharge - Recover 1% of your maximum mana per second. Points into this ability increase its duration. This ability has a 2 minute cooldown that is unaffected by cooldown reduction.
- New Level 1 Hunting Attack Spell: Double Shot - fire 2 powerful arrows in rapid succession. This replaces Arrow Barrage as the starter spell, Arrow Barrage is now a higher level spell.
- New Arrow Storm Synergy: Serrated Storm - gives Arrow Storm hits a chance to apply Wounds.
- New Chilling Touch Synergy: Necromancer's Hex - causes nearby summons to attack the target. This gives you finer control of your summons.

Summon Changes/Fixes:
- Summons deal a little less damage than before.
- Summons now go poof when they disappear.
- Summons now disappear if you die or change dimensions (this is to prevent crashes).
- Summons have about 25% less HP (they had too much with the recent addition of bonus HP per level).
- Summons move a little slower now.
- Fixed an issue where Summon Attacks weren't actually being registered as attacks.
- Fixed an issue where attacking an untamed tameable entity would cause errors.

Spell Balance Changes:

- The synergies of the above spells have been buffed.
- Reduced the energy cost of most attack spells.
- Reduced the cooldown of every spell EXCEPT: Whirlwind, Heavy Strike, Basic Spells, Arrow Barrage, Arrow Storm, Craft Arrow, Dash, Exert/Imbue, Hunting Potion, Summons, Poisoned Weapons.
- Some spells like Fire Bombs, Lightning Totem, and a few others' radius now scales with ability level.
- Life Siphon can no longer be set to right-click.
- Life Siphon cooldown has been increased (didn't realize the cooldown was shorter than the duration).
- Animate Scythe now does the two hits at the same time instead of a channel. Channelling messes with right click binding code.
- Chilling Touch costs slightly more energy now.
- Poison Balls has been renamed to Poison Ball again.
- Poison Ball only fires 1 projectile again.
- Poison Ball has been reworked. It is now a slow (but faster than before) moving orb that pulses every x ticks to deal damage to nearby enemies (like a slower version of Ice Orb). Increasing its level will increase its tick rate, radius, and duration.
- Poison Ball now travels 50% faster.
- Poison Ball can travel through enemies and disappears upon block impact.

- Charged Sweep now scales at a higher rate with mana.

- Increased cost of Craft Arrows.
- Arrow Barrage is now a level 30 spell.
- Arrow Barrage fires 1-2 less arrows by max level than previously.
- Arrow Barrage cooldown has increased.
- Arrow Barrage wounds synergy now belongs to Double Shot, and the chance of applying has increased.
- Wounds effect now stacks up to 5.
- Wounds effect slow has been reduced from 25% to 10%. Also, it now says this on the tooltip. How many of you knew Wounds actually slowed?

Stat Changes:
- New Stat: Dodge Ignore - it's basically armor pen but for dodge.
- New Stat: Increased Duration.

- Staff weapons can now roll 2 elemental attack stats as the primary stats. Before they were either pure physical, or physical + an element. Now they can be fire + frost, for example.

## [2.10.7] - 2021-06-25

### Updates
- Decreased the chance of finding loot crates in Bountiful boards.
- Bountiful loot crate rewards now require more (and difficult) tasks before they start appearing.

### Mine and Slash Updates
Stat Changes:
- Stat changes below are to encourage users to pour into other stats instead of just a single stat. Also, some changes, such as moving mana/magic shield regen to wisdom were made to make putting stats into wisdom feel less "bad" when not going for magic shield. You'll notice I basically shifted things around.
- Vit (before): health, health regen --> (after) health, armor
- Strength (before): physical damage, armor --> (after) physical damage, critical damage
- Intelligence (before): elemental spell damage, mana, mana regen --> (after) elemental spell damage, magic shield, mana
- Wisdom (before): magic shield, magic shield regen --> (after) heal power, magic shield regen, mana regen
- Dexterity (before): critical hit chance, critical hit damage, dodge --> (after) dodge, critical hit chance, armor pen.
- Stamina (before): health, energy, energy regen --> (after) health regen, energy, energy regen
- Vitality gives 25% less armor than what strength used to give.
- Strength now gives 33% more physical damage percent than it did before.
- 2 new stats: armor pen. and heal power have been introduced to the core stats.

Map Changes:
- Added 3 new rooms to the map pools. One for each of the following: Nature map, Ice Temple map, Sewers map.
- Maybe added 1 secret new room to ALL map pools...
- Map affix pool has more than doubled, maps are probably going to be harder.
- Maps now give bonus EXP in addition to bonus loot.
- Painful Truths has been reworked to halve bonus loot and quadruple bonus EXP instead of shifting bonus loot to bonus EXP.
- Map reward structure has been reworked. Before, bonus EXP/loot was mostly dependent on # of affixes. Now, different affixes affect the EXP/loot bonus differently.
- Less weapon damage map affixes has been removed.
- Increased mob density in maps by approximately 50%.
- Added some variability to mob spawn amounts.
- Brightened up a bunch of the map rooms that were too dark.
- Fixed some mobs/chests not spawning properly in maps.
- Made it harder to fall into lava on some maps.
- Chests now do not always spawn in maps (but there are more chest locations). This only does not apply to the scrabble chests.

Other Changes:
- Vampire perk now gives some multi again.
- Energy regen stat has been buffed slightly.
- Tooltip improvement for dodge/spell dodge.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Mine and Slash, FPS Reducer.
- Added Out Of Sight - should improve framerates when near giant modded factories. It basically stops tile entities from rendering if they're further than a configured distance.

### Fixes
- Disabled Apotheosis life mending curse.
- Fixed the fruit tree quest requiring the wrong orange sapling.
- Fixed Zoataur's causing crashes in dungeons.

## [2.10.6] - 2021-06-17

### Updates
- Negative affixes have been reworked and there aren't really any left. Some may have tradeoff stats.
- In general, most stats no longer have "increased..." and are mostly flat % increases. The increased stat caused a lot of confusion. It still exists, just less commonly. This applies to uniques/sets/runewords too.
- Flaming Devil set now provides spellsteal instead of lifesteal.
- Will of Lightning set now provides flat critical hit instead of percent.
- Reduced difficulty and drop rate of Dimensional Dungeons.
- Players have been provided with spell and talent reset potions.

### Mine and Slash Updates
- There's a lot.

General Changes:
- Salvage Station now only takes 3 seconds per item, instead of 5.
- Magic shield flat stat has been reduced in effectiveness by about 20%. It is now slightly harder to get magic shield, but by investing in it, you can get even more than previously.
- Magic shield percent stat has been improved by more than double.
- Improved item tooltips. You can now see if the item is unsalvagable without holding shift. Unique "lore" text is now a italicized and gray.
- You can now see what bonuses set items give without needing to equip them. No more "locked" set bonuses, they number now appears red instead, indicating they're not applying.
- Fixed missing localization for spell costs.
- Spells that modify attack scaling now display how much they'll modify it by if you hold shift.
- Cleaned up the Stat Info GUI.
- I'm slowly trying to phase out "increased" stats as they cause a lot of confusion.

Talent Tree:
- Blood Mage HP multi has increased from 10% -> 15%.
- Overflowing Vitality now gives a -10% HP multi instead of 20%.
- Bleed Mastery now gives -25% to all elemental damage instead of -20%.
- Fortified Reaction now gives a -20% multi to armor instead of -25% multi to dodge. I believe the multiplier was applying after the conversion, therefore not doing anything.
- Warlock now gives 20% DoT lifesteal instead of 80%. Yeah I don't really know what I was thinking. I made this before the DoT buffs, okay?
- Magical Life now gives -20% multi to health instead of -25% multi to magic shield for reasons similar to above. It also now only gives 20% cooldown reduction instead of 25%.
- Pacifist now gives 30% FLAT heal power instead of multi, and -30% FLAT spell power instead of -90% multi.
- Reckless Blows now gives 25% FLAT penetration rather than multi. It now gives -30% multi also to dodge and magic shield.
- Ruthless now gives 40% DoT damage instead of 50%. It also gives -25% spell damage instead of -30%.
- Steady Hand now gives 20% more damage, down from 25%.
- Vampire now give a FLAT 6% attack lifesteal and 3% spell lifesteal instead of giving multi. This was a good node but only after investing enough points. I want this to be impactful early game as well.
- Changed the Talent Tree major elemental weapon damage nodes to big. So that's 60% -> 30%. 60% is crazy.
- Changed the Talent Tree weapon nodes at the bottom of the tree from big to major.
- Changed some Talent Tree mana nodes from big to small, and major to big.
- Increased magic shield and magic shield regen Talent Tree node effectiveness.

Spells:
- Attack Spell synergies now also increase the energy cost.
- Spells that can be set as right click on melee weapons can now also be set on staves/wands. These are technically melee..
- Attack Spells now require a melee weapon to be used. You can no longer cast Flame Blitz with a bow in hand...
- Fixed a bug where Attack Spells weren't actually triggering on-attack effects.
- Reworded some tooltips to make more sense.

Ocean Spells:
- Tidal Wave base value has increased at higher levels.
- Tidal Wave synergy, Freezing Waves, now correctly applies as spell damage instead of "other" damage. This means increases to spell damage now properly affect it.

Fire Spells:
- Flame Blitz attacks per second has increased.

- Reduced the chance of generating a Burn stack on attack with Flame Blitz slightly at higher levels.

- Charged Sweep has had a small rework. It now gains less AOE per level, casts instantly instead of being a channel, and has a much lower cooldown.

- Charged Sweep synergy, Static Discharge, now grants a much higher chance of applying Static stacks.
- Lightning Spear now has a lower base value at low levels, but a higher base value at max level.

- Poison Balls now has higher physical attack scaling.
- Poisoned Weapons now gives a little more nature attack damage.
- Thorn Armor synergy, Thorny Armor, has been renamed to Spiked Armor.

- Hunting Potion cooldown now reduces at double the rate per level.
- Arrow Barrage physical attack scaling has been reduced.
- Arrow Barrage, Wide Shot, and Recoil Shot projectile speed has changed to a static amount rather than increasing per level. This is a buff for earlier levels but a 'nerf' for later levels.

- Wide Shot max projectile count has been reduced from 9 to 7 at max level.
- Recoil Shot physical scaling value has increased slightly.

### Fixes
- Disabled Upgrade Aquatic jellyfish spawns.

- Disabled Quark reach-around placing. Nice feature but it breaks Maps. Can't have that!

## [2.10.5] - 2021-06-13

### Updates
- Had to remove Serene Seasons. It's a shame that it has issues with the Mirror dimension. It was a tough call, but I prioritize the ARPG experience over an enhanced farming experience... Serene Seasons, you will be missed!

### Mod Updates
- Updated Clumps, Mine and Slash.

- Lycanites bosses can now naturally despawn (hopefully). No more glitchy Amalgalich?
- Arbitrary crash with tool belts should be fixed.
- Disabled the Rolling Mill recipe as it's been causing crashes.

## [2.10.4] - 2021-06-10

### Updates
- Updated to Forge 31.2.50.
- Pretty large QoL update for Mine and Slash, with some mechanical changes to how some "attack" spells work! Tons of new builds should arise from this!
- Added two new items: Structure's Compass and Simple Magnet. Simple Magnet can pick up items up to 3 blocks away, and Structure's Compass is basically Nature's Compass, but for structures instead of biomes.
- Simple Magnets are charms and can be equipped with Mine and Slash stats, but are always at common or uncommon rarity.
- New quest in the Prelude showcasing the Structure's Compass. 
- New 4 new quests in the Technology Tree showcasing the Simple Magnet magnets.

### Mine and Slash Updates
- New damage type: Attack Spells. These can trigger "on-attack" effects such as Poisoned Weapon's synergy, or Frozen/Petrify on-attack effects. They are also still affected by changes to spell damage.
- Previous spells such as Whirlwind, Martyrdom, Retribution, Tidal Waves, Flame Blitz, etc., are now Attack Spells.
- All Hunting spells that use arrows are now classified as Attack Spells.
- Hunting spells that use arrows are now properly physical damage. They can still deal elemental damage with the new "attack spell damage type".
- Spells that previously scaled off of all attack damage now scale off of physical attack damage only. Elemental attack damage will now apply separately instead of being converted into a single element. This is technically a small nerf late-game as you can't really "double-dip" for spells that converted from all elements -> one element. But should be unchanged early game. Plus, with the new damage type... Melee and Archery got buffed pretty hard late game.
- Spell tooltips have been revamped to clearly indicate whether something is a Attack Spell, Spell, etc.
- Spell tooltips now show "tags" to give players a better idea of what to expect from the spell.
- Poison Cloud now applies more stacks of Thorns per cast.
- Base value of Thorns effect has been increased.

- Petrify can now be broken with spell hits as well.
- Cleaned up Judgment effect tooltip.
- Fixed Battery Fusillade not going on cooldown when canceled.
- Added right-click-ability to all spells with a low enough cooldown.
- You can now set movement spells to right click, holding shift to use these were clunky. Stick them on a separate weapon!
- Added extra tooltip info for spells that can be set as right-click.
- Cleared up tooltip info regarding spells and attacks.
- Renamed Fireball to Fire Ball, Tidal Wave to Tidal Waves, and Frostball to Ice Bolt.
- Renamed the Regenerate effect from Nature's Balm to Soothe to prevent confusion with the regen stat.
- Soothe now plays a sound and particles on each heal.
- Mana Battery no longer only takes effect above 25% max mana, and instead always will reduce damage.
- Mana Battery damage reduction has been reduced from 50% -> 30%.
- Mana Battery no longer gives -10% Health multi.
- Mana Battery now gives -60% Armor/Dodge multi, up from -40%.

- Talent and spell reset potions have been provided.

### Mine and Slash Updates
- Medium-sized talent tree update: some areas of the tree have been reworked to incorporate FOUR new gamechanger perks, and a new perk type. A lot of the changes are top-right heavy. Some general balance changes have also been made.
- New Perk/Stat type: Increased Damage over Time Damage - this affects DoT effects ONLY (not spells like Blizzard). Currently, this means Burn, Thorns, Wounds, and Bleed. These perks can be found throughout the tree.
- New Stat: DoT Lifesteal - steals HP from DoT effects. Before, when effects such as Burn were considered spell damage, it was possible to leech from those effects. This is meant as a replacement, but currently there is only one way to get it (Warlock node).
- New Gamechanger Node: Ruthless - Increases DoT damage, but reduces spell damage.
- New Gamechanger Node: Warlock - gives your DoTs a HUGE lifesteal effect and slightly increases DoT damage at the expense of your health and magic shield.
- New Gamechanger Node: Side Step - provides bonuses to dodge and spell dodge at the expense of armor, magic shield, and block chance.
- New Gamechanger Node: Power Overwhelming - provides a large bonus to spell damage, but removes chance to crit.
- Changed percent infusion on the tree to flat infusion.
- Small buff to weapon damage talent nodes from 5% -> 6%.
- Small buff to weapon elemental damage talent nodes from 8% -> 12%.
- Small buff to phys damage talent nodes from 3% -> 8%. This apparently only affects basic attack physical damage. No wonder physical late game was so bad!
- Changed a lot of the phys damage talent nodes to apply to ALL phys damage.
- Added a FEW energy regen nodes around the tree. I realized that energy shouldn't be specific to bottom-right as everyone uses it.
- Collapsed some really large elemental wheels (mostly top of tree) into smaller combined wheels to make space for other effects.
- New Synergy for Spell Blade: Flame Blade - causes basic attacks to deal AOE fire damage upon hitting an enemy while under the effects of Spell Blade.
- Spell Blade and Poisoned Weapons have received major buffs.
- Holy Retribution and Poison Thorn Seeker are now affected by increase spell damage stats.
- Bleed now deals 25% of your weapon damage per stack, up from 8%! I realized even 64% of weapon damage per second is not very good. Now be rewarded when you apply max stacks. :)
- Reduced the duration of Bleed from 8s -> 6s.
- Reduced damage of Burn at max level by about 9%.
- Increased max stacks of Burn from 4 -> 6.
- Burn now always ticks every second and does not scale per level.
- Increased the damage of Thorns by some amount.
- Increased max stacks of Thorns from 10 -> 12.
- Thorns now always ticks every 2 seconds and does not scale per level.
- Increased duration of Thorns and Burn.
- Wounds now scales with attack damage instead of having a base damage. This should make it actually worthwhile to apply, as 3 stacks are applied at once with Recoil Shot.
- Wounds now always ticks every second and does not scale per level.
- Wounds now reduces health regeneration rather than heal power.
- Battery Fusilade's Overcharge radius increases with level.
- Fixed Wounds not applying multiple stacks at once.
- Fixed a bug where Wounds was lasting much longer than it was supposed to.
- Fixed Bleed mastery not working properly.
- Added a death message for custom_damage.
- Improved tooltips for some of the conversion stats.
- Added extra tooltip info for some spells.
- Added DoT tooltip indicator for DoT effects.
- Fixed some missing localization.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Mine and Slash, Xaero's.

## [2.10.2] - 2021-06-07

### Updates
- I'm aware of the flickering occurring when someone goes into the Overworld Mirror dimension. This is caused by Serene Seasons - basically the seasons are continually skipping while someone is in the Mirror dim. If possible, I'd like to keep both this dimension AND Serene Seasons. A fix is being looked into, please be patient!
- Players can no longer eat Chorus Fruit in Dim Dungeons.
- Endermen and Shulkers no longer teleport in Dim Dungeons.
- Players have been provided with a spell reset potion for the update below.

### Mine and Slash Updates
- Fixed effects not actually applying to enemies/allies... This whole time buffs and curses didn't even work as intended!!!
- Damage from allies should no longer affect magic shield!
- Managed to get the stack effects working again! That means effects like Burn, Thorns, Bleed now have more than a max stack of 1, and stacking the effect will increase the stat and damage effects! Most of the effects have been reworked (and in most cases, buffed).
- An example of above: Bleed now has a max of 8 stacks, and instead of doing 25% of your phys damage per second, you do 8% per stack for a max of 64% (yes this is also a huge buff).
- Buff spells now apply to allies only and not enemies. Yeah, I know.
- Effect levels can now have points put into them starting at level 5. It didn't make sense to be able to Burn enemies at level 5, but the Burn effect itself did nothing till level 10.
- Defend armor buff has been nerfed by 20%.
- Frost Shield now has a longer cooldown but also applies Magic Shield Regen.
- Reduced the power, increased the cooldown of Retribution - especially the early game.
- Increased number of projectiles at max level for Retribution.
- Fires of Judgment now gives Purifying Fires a chance to apply Judgment instead of dealing extra damage to targets with Judgment.
- Holy Retribution now provides extra armor scaling to damage if target has Judgment instead of giving Retribution the chance to apply Judgment.
- Judgment is now a skillable passive rather than being tied to Spear of Judgment.
- Judgment now scales alone rather than off of the Spear of Judgment spell.
- Burn, Thorns are now DOT damage type and not spell damage type.
- Revamped Spell GUI a bit - colour of text now indicates whether you cannot put points, have points in it, or are receiving + bonus level to spells. Also, unavailable spells no longer have a "red background" and instead have lower saturation.
- Completely new set of spell icons thanks to Skullbushi! Check out their work here: https://www.instagram.com/skullbushi/

### Mod Updates
- Updated Mine and Slash, Calemi's Utilities, Dimensional Dungeons, GeckoLib.

### Fixes
- Create crash has been fixed (probably) when trying to place a sail against a regular block (thanks Calemi).
- Disabled Create rendering which should fix the shaft crashes.

## [2.10.1] - 2021-05-31

### Updates

- New Fire Spell: Steam Cloud - emit steam from your body, damaging nearby enemies for a brief duration.

- Increased saturation of GUI bar elements.
- Swapped colour for energy bar and EXP bar.
- Changed colour of mana and magic shield to keep it more consistent. Magic Shield = Aqua, Mana = Blue.
- Magic Shield overlay now doesn't completely overlap the health bar. Now you can see how much HP you're losing due to environmental effects (no more random deaths?).
- Arcane Devotion is now a -95% multi to HP instead of -1000%. Users should be able to "counterplay" environmental effects rather than being killed with no way out.
- Battery Fusilade's Overcharge synergy now has an AOE of 1, down from 2.
- Exert now grants arrows with an AOE of 1, down from 2.

- NOTE: YOU MAY NEED TO START A NEW WORLD FOR THIS UPDATE. BACK UP YOUR WORLD! DUNGEON CRAWL UPDATE MAY OR MAY NOT BREAK YOUR EXISTING WORLD.
- NOTE: YOU WILL NEED TO RESET YOUR SPELLS FOR THIS UPDATE. A SPELL RESET POTION SHOULD BE PROVIDED.
- New dimension which mimics the Overworld! The main reason I added this mod was so that MineColonies could be kept on the main Overworld, while this world could function as an "adventure" Overworld dimension. Mobs and structures should be the same on both. The travel factor should be 1:1 between this world and the Overworld! The Overworld Mirror is mainly for server longevity, but may still be useful for players in singleplayer worlds. You CANNOT make colonies in the Overworld Mirror dimension.
- Added a quest to guide players into the Overworld Mirror dimension.
- This update introduces a few new spells and some balance changes. See below for details!

- Reduced spawn weight of some Better Animals Plus mobs.
- Dungeon Crawl dungeons have changed and can include mobs from other mods!
- Some Nether quests have been made a little easier.

### Mine and Slash Updates
- New Nature Spell: Rock Slide - a spell that summons a rock barrage on enemies.
- New Fire Spell: Lava Quake - a cone AoE melee spell.
- New Hunting Spell: Exert - similar to Imbue, buffs your arrow spells. But instead of adding damage, arrows will explode on contact and do half damage in a small area. This effect CAN stack with Imbue.

- New Synergy for Battery Fusilade: Overcharge - projectiles release a small AoE upon hitting an enemy.
- Dash now propels you twice as fast/far.
- Lightning Spear mana cost reduced slightly.
- Fire Ball now travels almost 3x faster and lasts 1 second instead of 3 seconds. It should feel a lot more responsive to use now.

- Imbue now provides less of a damage boost.

- Added Random Patches again.
- Removed DEUF (server-only).

### Fixes
- Disabled Lycanites fire charge items.
- Tidal Wave and Retribution no longer multi-hit (unintended).

## [2.9.3b] - 2021-03-23

### Updates
- Reduced spell points per level back to 2 from 3. 3 was way too much.
- Made some of the Nether quests a less tedious.
- When Dungeons Arise update introduces new structures and rebalances some of the existing structures.
- Reduced damage and health of Dimensional Dungeons mobs.
- Some Atum loot is no longer salvagable and can no longer reroll as uniques (staves, brooches, idols). This is do prevent an exploitable bug.

### Mod Updates
- Updated When Dungeons Arise.
- Removed Mowzie's Mobs temporarily. It's still new and a little buggy.

### Fixes
- Fixed crashes from Mowize's Mobs by removing it (lol).

## [2.9.3] - 2021-03-16

### Updates
- HUGE fundamental change to the mastery system. Your spells and the stat bonus from mastery level now scales based on the TOTAL mastery level, rather than per tree. That means you can have 30 points in the Fire tree at level 30, instead of being forced to go 15 Fire and 15 *insert element*. This means you can get higher level skills quicker without being "punished" for mono-speccing. This change also makes spells scale off of your total mastery level, meaning you can have just 1 point in Ocean and 1 point in Frostball, and 10 points in Fire, and your Frostball will be effectively scaled to level 11! Additionally, at level 100, there are no fundamental changes, as you'd still have 50 points into 2 trees given the old system, and the new system. Have fun!
- Increased skill points per level from 2 to 3! You will probably need to consume a spell reset potion to get the skills points. I did this because speccing into 2 trees was quite difficult given how you had to allocate 2 points every other level to mastery. Given the new system, you will still allocated 1 point per level, so this doesn't change.
- A free spell reset potion has been provided for the above change.
- The new Mine and Slash update also rebalances a bunch of the spells, introduces new synergies, and reduces the cooldowns of almost all the spells.
- Non-M&S equipment can now be salvaged!!! This does not include wooden and stone equipment, though.
- Increased drop rate of equipment by 25%, and reduced drop rate of non-M&S equipment by 50%.
- Reduced how powerful some of the elemental mob affixes were. They were definitely overtuned for lower levels!
- Mowzie's Mobs introduces 8 new very unique mobs, and some new equipment! 2 of which have been added to the Midnight dimension to spruce it up a bit!
- New gauranteed unique axe from the Mowzie Wrought.
- Increased spawn rate of Rotten Eskimos by 40%.
- Added a bunch of new quests to the Overworld focused on mob killing, and reworked Beastiary III.
- Spawners take have half the hardness they previously had.
- Halved spawn rate of Dungeons Arise dungeons - they were really cool but too frequent.
- Rebound enchantment max level has been reduced to 1.
- Added a new community server to the default server list! Welcome Path to Craft! Thanks for your support.

## [2.9.0] - 2021-02-27

### Updates
- With Create Additions replacing Create Integration, the update to Create v0.3e is made possible! Check out the new blocks from 0.3e and have fun! Finally!
- Technology quest line has been reworked slightly. There are about 5 new quests.
- HUGE Mine and Slash spell rebalance update, and some mechanic reworks. TL;DR defense was buffed, armor getting buffed more than the others. Block has been changed from a flat damage reduction to a percent chance to block all damage, and still reducing damage by 25% if you fail to block. See the full changelog here: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mine-and-slash-reloaded/files/3220907
- A talent reset potion has been provided in lieu of the talent tree changes.
- 3 new mobs have been introduced by Outvoted - a mod that brings creatures from the Minecraft live mob votes! Find the Inferno in the Nether, and the Hunger and Kraken in the Overworld! Also, craft the new Inferno Shield from level 21-30, which has a low chance of becoming a unique.
- Beastiary quests have been reworked to showcase Outvoted. The beastiary quest icons have also been changed to better reflect the mob you're hunting.
- MineColonies quest line has been expanded!
- Improved the tooltips of many quests, especially the "first quests" of acts. They now indicate which quests you need to complete to access them! Hopefully no one will wonder why they can't finish The End quest when randomly coming across a end portal.
- Set undead miner's spawn rate to 0. They spawned regardless of light level and condition...
- Set the Mummy and Ancient Mummy spawn rates to 0. They were causing crashes. I also feel comfortable removing these because of the newly added Outvoted mobs. Bounties and quests in regards to these mobs have also been removed/reworked.
- Reduced the reward weight of Cauldrons on bounties.
- Lowered the weight of common objectives in bounties (less killing).
- You can now disable spawners by placing 5 torches on them.

## [2.8.7] - 2021-02-11

### Updates
- IT'S FINALLY HERE. Partying now only requires /slash party! You do NOT need to use /team anymore.
- /team will remain in the pack as I see no harm in keeping it. Just remember you don't have to use it for partying! Teamed questing is coming soon to a modpack near you...
- Spawners are no longer unbreakable. However, it takes substantially longer to break them (obsidian hardness), so it's still more worthwhile to just torch up the place instead of trying to break the spawner. This will circumvent the issue of pirate raids being uncompletable, and will allow players to still break them if they really want to. Note: it was my intention to make dungeons substantially harder with this change.
- When Dungeons Arise dungeons are slightly less frequent.
- Various Mine and Slash changes, view the changelog here: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mine-and-slash-reloaded/files/3200946
- Increased difficulty and rewards of Dimensional Dungeons. Remember, they can drop tier 5 loot!
- You can receive dark pearls from thrown geodes again. I didn't realize they were used as fuel for the Midnight furnaces.
- Enabled the true infinity enchantment (might also me known as endless quiver), which should function with all arrows. Do not that some other arrow types may not function properly, such as arrows that do extra damage, due to Mine and Slash damage methods.
- The client now comes bundled with FTB Backups as well (affects SP). By default, it will auto backup every 2 hours.

### Mod Updates
- Updated When Dungeons Arise, Craft to Exile Custom Uniques, Collective, Areas, Mine and Slash, Xaero's.

- Mine and Slash naming conventions, tooltips, and descriptions are hopefully more consistent and more clear now.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Productive Bees, Xaero's, Mine and Slash, MineColonies.
- Added When Dungeons Arise.
- Added Unbreakable Spawner - mob spawners are now unbreakable.

### Fixes
- Nature scaling now scales properly.
- Fixed a misguiding tooltip regarding spawners. They no longer say you can mine them with Silk Touch. In fact, you can't even mine them at all anymore.

## [2.8.5c] - 2021-01-29

### Mod Updates
- Updated MineColonies, Better Animals Plus.

### Fixes
- Fixed unique fire hammer and water bow not working.

## [2.8.5b] - 2021-01-28

### Mod Updates
- Updated Craft to Exile Custom Uniques.

### Fixes
- Some fixes to uniques.

## [2.8.5] - 2021-01-27

### Updates
- New Patreon-designed unique plate chest by QuetzaCoco: Vessel of Charisma! For those of you who enjoy magic find and raw damage, this is the chest for you! A truly glass-cannon armor, this chest reduces your defensive prowess to give you power overwhelming. Thanks for your support Quetza!
- Increased drop rate of maps.
- Reduced drop rate of unique items and runed gear.
- Increased mob difficulty scaling by about 50% at max level.
- Unique bows have all been given appropriate models and names.
- Overall balance changes regarding uniques. Magic find uniques are generally MORE rare to find now, and some values have been reduced slightly. Some uniques have been reduced in power, and some have been brought back up to "standards". For example, Headhunter's flat physical damage has been changed to percent, and most unique bows have been buffed.
- Productive Bee's Mine and Slash bees have been SUPER, SUPER nerfed.
- Some leather and plate uniques have been standardized with the armor and health stats.

### Mod Updates
- Mine and Slash, Craft to Exile Custom Uniques, Corpse Complex, MineColonies, Xaero's, Productive Bees.

### Fixes
- Hopefully tiers should properly register when uniques drop in non-map worlds now.

## [2.8.4] - 2021-01-20

### Updates
- New Patreon-designed unique bow by Chesty Puller: Righteous Sentience Puller! Check out this awesome build-around bow that scales off of your health. Thanks for your support!
- Huge update to the Mine and Slash talent tree, as well as various game balance changes and bug fixes. View the changelog here: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mine-and-slash-reloaded/files/3175536
- You have been provided with another talent reset potion.
- Removed all the loot crates obtainable from the quests. They have been replaced with more modern and specific loot crates. Instead of the generic "equipment" and "currency" crate, we now have weapon, armor, jewelry, warrior/mage/ranger, currency, and map crates. These new crates are also level specific, so no more hoarding crates until you're level 80.
- At the end of every act after Act III, you now receive a map crate.
- Removed the Richard Rider quest and replaced it with a new mob to make the questing experience smoother.
- Reworded some Gaia quests to make them easier to accomplish and combined some of the quests.
- Mining Dimension is now capped at level 50 instead of 100.
- Reduced the amount of flat physical damage you could get from suffixes. The forceful prefix remains unchanged.
- Increased the cost of the crates in Calemi's market by x5. This is NOT in response to any duping bugs, but rather I misjudged how easy it would be to get coins legitimately. You should no longer need to "rely" on these chests while leveling as I have put in a BUNCH of crate rewards from quests. These are meant to be money sinks in the LATE game (70-100).

### Mod Updates
- Updated Productive Bees, Curios, Xaero's, Mine and Slash, Craft to Exile Custom Uniques.

### Fixes
- Fixed not being able to craft Mining Dimension block.
- Fixed some stonecutter issues.
- Blacklisted Malachite Guards from spawners.

## [2.8.3] - 2021-01-12

- New official Patreon server is packaged with this update!
- Pretty large Mine and Slash update. View the changelog here: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mine-and-slash-reloaded/files/3166056!
- Made the Malachite Guard (last boss) immensely more difficult. Also much more rewarding!
- Changed some Nether quests.
- Swapped quest positions of Restructurer and Minerals III.
- Players have been provided with more reset potions because of the Mine and Slash update.
- Increased difficulty of Dimensional Dungeons (like x2-x3 harder), but also increased rewards. I want to stress: I'm trying to make this a group-based dimension! I want to make it so that as a group this is completely doable and rewarding.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Caelus API, Productive Bees, MineColonies, Mine and Slash, Advanced Mining Dimension.

### Fixes
- Elytras should work again as intended.
- Disabled Hoglin spawn since it was causing severe Nether lag.
- Attempt at preventing Lycanites levels during invasions.

## [2.8.2] - 2021-01-06

### Updates
- Sorry for constant updates - I thought the item pickup and suffocation fixes warranted pushing this out early. This should be the last for a while assuming the change directly below doesn't break dimensions.
- Dimensional Dungeons should be able to drop tier 4+ uniques now (may or may not work).
- Pretty large update to Mine and Slash once again. Since all the updates are from M&S this time around, I'll paste the changelog here (rest of Updates is M&S):
- New stat: Spell Lifesteal! Lifesteal, but for spells!
- Added lifesteal and spell lifesteal nodes to the tree.
- Life/spell lifesteal now has a minimum of 1. So even if you do 6 damage with 1% lifesteal, you will still heal 1 HP.
- Major Arcana stat "Judgment" now provides spell lifesteal, and the "thirst of" affixes provide a minor amount of spell lifesteal instead of lifesteal.
- Increased crit hit and damage percents and multis, flat values are still the same.
- Nature's Balm has had its values readjusted again (buff).
- Flat physical damage values have been lowered, but percent has been increased. This means physical will about 20% less damage early game, but investing into physical damage will improve it about 30% more.
- Increased early game effectiveness of Retribution.
- Fixed some localization typos and made some stats/skills more clear. "Judgment" is now spelled correctly, yay!
- Plate gear now also provides armor.
- Leather gear provides a bit less HP.
- Increased durability of equipment, especially at lower rarities.
- Lessened the effect of gear damage on loot drop at lower levels. You will still definitely feel this at higher levels.
- Vanilla ores provide a little more fuel than they used to.
- Setting tiers in the Dimension Config should work now.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Performant, Mine and Slash.

- Inability to pickup items sometimes should be fixed.

- Fixing dependencies.

## [2.8.1] - 2021-01-05

- HUGE Mine and Slash update. You have been provided with a spell reset potion. Check the changelog over at https://github.com/mahjerion/Mine-and-Slash/blob/1.15.2/changelog.txt!
- Greatly reduced frequency of invasions (I'm talking like 10-15x less frequent).
- Legendary Ore Bees are no longer a thing. Misleading since legendary ore doesn't spawn!
- Rathpith's Globe now provides increased critical hit chance instead of flat.
- Disabled Sulfur Bees.
- Reduced critical hit from the unique critical ring.
- Dimensional Dungeon mobs now have much, much more HP.
- Added 2 new Nether quests showcasing the Extended Nether update a bit.
- Changed the dependencies for the quests linked to The Crux to now require Getting Started instead. This should allow for a smoother start.
- Reduced spawn rate of zombies and baby zombies slightly.
- Maps are 33% more likely to drop.
- New updated look for the Craft to Exile menu!

### Mod Updates
- Updated Extended Nether Backport, MineColonies, Mine and Slash, Productive Bees.
- Added FancyMenu.
- Added Open Loader.
- Removed Global Data Pack.
- Removed PackMenu.
- Removed It's The Little Things.
- Removed Better Title Screen.
- Removed XL Packets.

### Fixes

- Nether crashes should more or less be resolved.
- Fixed an issue with Productive Bees datapacks.
- With the removal of It's The Little Things and XL Packets, very rare crashes upon start should be resolved.
- Fixed some broken runewords.

## [2.8.0b] - 2021-01-01

### Fixes
- Fixed Mine and Slash ores not working properly.

## [2.8.0] - 2020-12-31

### Updates
- New Patreon-designed unique ring by Whiterun Mage: Milk Maid's Nose Ring! Thanks for your support!
- 6 new runewords! 5 of which are meant to be mid-level runewords for leveling, and 1 of which is a support runeword!
- Introducing: random invasions! Every 1-2 hours there is a chance than an invasion will trigger. There are currently 3 types of invasions: the undead invasion which can occur in any dimension (except the Good Night Sleep dimensions), the exile invasion which is basically a raid and can occur in any dimension, and a vanilla invasion which can only occur in the Overworld.
- New Mine and Slash bees! Thanks Jonn!
- Mine and Slash ore can now be silk touched and used in technology mods.
- Mine and Slash skills have been slightly balanced again. See the Mine and Slash changelog for more details, but tl;dr fire small nerf, ball spells small nerf.
- You now earn extra total EXP when in a party. See Mine and Slash changelog for details.
- Map drop rates have increased in maps.
- Runewords have been buffed.
- Mobs from raids now scale to player level.
- Nerfed loot and experience gain from Endermen.
- Elder Guardians are now much more difficult and have increased drop rates.
- Decreased Ender Dragon health by 17% and increased damage by 50%.
- Disabled the Legendary Ore --> Penny recipe. It's original purpose was to ensure that servers with limited world gen could still get RC even when raritarium ran out. But with the introduction of RC in Bountiful rewards amongst other things, it's not really needed anymore.
- Gave End: Reborn's Simple Quartz the quartz tag so it's less useless now. Also added a recipe to turn anything tagged as quartz to vanilla quartz, should the need arise.
- Reverted MineColonies citizen tick rates to 1. For the most part, unless you're on a large server, 1 should be fine (does not apply to Official Servers).
- Lycanites bosses can now only be summoned in the Nether.
- Disabled Lycanites taming treats. They were useless since taming was disabled, just misled new players.
- Geodes now give Midnight ores instead of Dark Pearls when thrown.
- Dark Pearl function has been disabled by default.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Serene Seasons, MineColonies, Structurize, Xaero's, Mine and Slash, Productive Bees.
- The update for Create will come in a future update. Still waiting on Create Integration to update.
- Removed Rough Mobs Revamped - doesn't really add much anymore besides mobs with equipment. Granted, removing this may make some of the vanilla mobs "easier", but this mod introduces a lot of issues with entity AI. Will monitor crash rates after removing, if removing this did nothing, I'll probably add it back in.

### Fixes
- Fixed a bunch of log spam by resolving some datapack errors. These were intentional but I found a better way to disable some recipes without breaking the datapack.
- Fixed an impossible Tropics quest.
- A few Mine and Slash party fixes, as well as bleed sound issues.
- Various Productive Bee issues have been fixed. See their changelog for more details.
- Fixed the wording on the Soulstone to not mislead players about taming.
- Tefnut's Call should now be registered as a trident.

## [2.7.3c] - 2020-12-14

### Fixes
- I forgot to include the Global Data Packs folder...

## [2.7.3b] - 2020-12-14

### Fixes
- Fixed a bunch of client-side changes not being implemented server-side.
- Fixed Nasty Mob configs not being applied correctly.

## [2.7.3] - 2020-12-14

### Updates
- You can now wear armor in a cosmetic slot - these pieces won't provide any bonuses but will alter your appearance!
- I decided to remove VanillaDeathChest, and will probably not look into adding any "death chest" mods. I tried testing GraveStone but it lacked some functionality that Corpse and VDC had. Unfortunately, Corpse doesn't work with MineColonies claims, and VDC doesn't respect the Corpse Complex (partial keepinventory rules). Since none of these mods really suit the pack's needs, I've decided to have keepinventory on by default via Corpse Complex with much greater penalties. FWIW, it was also quite troublesome to restore player inventories after bugs/glitches. Your currently existing shulker death chests will remain.
- You now keep your inventory upon death.
- You now lose 33% (up from 25%) of your XP and 33% of the durability on worn items and items on your hotbar. Cosmetic armor do not receive damage.
- Upon spawning, you are afflicted by slowness and hunger.
- Added a quest in Act IV that should help with Draconic Bees.
- Nerfed loot and experience gain from Endermite and Silverfish.
- Added a recipe that can turn non-vanilla forms of cobblestone into vanilla cobblestone.
- Increased update rate of MineColonies citizens.
- Modified some DynView settings for servers to drastically improve performance.
- Lowered Geonach spawn chance in the Mining Dimension.
- Disabled seasonal drop chances from Lycanites Mobs - unfortunately it's completely unconfigurable (it's hardcoded), and they grief...
- Nerfed the effeciency of some Bountiful objectives.
- Increased Dimensional Dungeon drop multiplier by 20%.

### Mod Updates
- Updated MineColonies, Mine and Slash.
- Added Cosmetic Armor Reworked.
- Added Patchouli - in case some players wanted some in-game documentation for Productive Bees.
- Removed VanillaDeathChest.

### Fixes
- Fixed a Waystone recipe error (Jipok).
- Fixed some console spam (Jipok).
- Disabled Endermites Form Shulker module from Quark, which caused crashes.
- Hopefully fixed MineColonies fishermen not working.
- Some map fixes.
- Fixed Nasty Skeletons not being configured properly. They should no longer knock your armour off or be super strong.
- Fixed a rare issue where players would accidentally place their Dank in maps and were not able to retrieve them.

## [2.7.2] - 2020-12-08

### Updates

### Updates

- Enabled Frostweaver spawns in some cold Overworld biomes.
- Updated Forge to 31.2.47.
- Vanilla Death Chest - increased protection timer from 5 in-game days to 20 in-game days.
- When returning from The Bumblezone, you now appear back where you entered. This makes more sense to me because you're "entering" the hive so you should exit the same place.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Dimensional Dungeons, Storage Drawers, Nasty Mobs, Initial Inventory, Xaero's, MineColonies.

### Fixes
- Fixed Ender Comb quest being uncompletable.
- Fixed Copper Comb and Fossilized Comb issues.
- Fixed some of The Bumblezone quests.
- Fixed Shulker Boxes in Dimensional Dungeons.
- Disabled honeycomb spawning in The Bumblezone due to some generation errors.

## [2.7.0c] - 2020-12-03

### Fixes
- Fixed scripts sometimes not loading I think.

- Fixed console spam from Mine and Slash.

## [2.7.0b] - 2020-12-02

### Updates
- Note: your corpse will disappear after updating! Make sure you get your belongings before you update.
- Some additional balancing for spells: went a little overboard last patch, ball spells have been buffed a bit again (damage-wise). Cooldowns for all other spells have been reduced GREATLY. Physical spells have been nerfed a bit.
- Changed Corpse for VanillaDeathChest because Corpse wasn't working with MineColonies claims. Shulker Boxes with your items will now spawn upon death.

## [2.7.0] - 2020-12-01

- A bunch of new skills and balance updates in Mine and Slash! General buffs towards ranged users, and changes for more interesting spell gameplay. Also, try out the new physical synergies, or the new Ice Orb spell!
- I've replaced BeeSourceful with Productive Bees. This was a change I wanted to do once things settled down a bit. Productive Bees is basically BeeSourceful on steroids. Also, it's been reported that BeeSourceful slows down world generation heavily - it's possible that Productive Bees will show better results in this regard.

I've tied it nicely with Mine and Slash and Create + Immersive Engineering. As a result, I've also added some quests to guide players in crafting the storage blocks.

### Mod Changes
- Added Custom Quests.
- Removed FTB Quests.

## [2.2.3] - 2020-08-21
The FTB Quests for Custom Quests change is likely a temporary fix until Custom Quest's rewrite comes out. This will probably result in another quest reset... And I apologize for that in advance. But the problems with current CQ are too great to ignore. The rewrite will likely not be available for a while, anyway. And I still would have to port stuff so that would take extra time. This change lets me make progression a lot more smooth! Thanks for supporting Craft to Exile.

Note: this update does NOT introduce shared questing. That will come with the CQ rewrite!

### Updates
- Working dimension detection, and selectable rewards are now available! This will require a quest reset, sorry! To access the new quest GUI, you'll need to set a key in your controls or use the new quest book. If you're installing a fresh install of [Dissonance], the default key is 'J'. TEAM QUESTING is still not available. I really thought FTB Quests had it, but it will not be implemented, apparently. In a few weeks time, Custom Quest's rewrite will be finished, and I can port all of the quests back over. There will be team questing, and everything nice.
- The Bumblezone is now an optional dimension.
- Added new quests to improve new player experience.
- TerraForged has been added due to popular demand and is the default world type for singleplayer worlds.

- Bosses appear more frequently in maps.
- Reduced damage of all mobs except bosses by roughly 20%.

- Time no longer passes in the Good Night dimensions.

## [2.2.0] - 2020-08-07

### Updates

- Act VII - new dimension: Tofu World! Explore this dimension after you've finished the Midnight... Wait, could this cute dimension be the source of all evil? Don't be deceived by the adorable creatures, they will try to kill you! Get to the Tofu World by making tofu. Grill the tofu and create a portal. You'll also need soy milk as well as a tofu stick (all explained in quest log). You can only craft the tofu stick once you've accessed the Midnight! Tofu World also brings about some new foods to try out!
- Enabled Tofu World compatibility with other mods, including crafting equipment.
- Added a new Act VII chapter in the quest log for Tofu World.
- Progression for The Bumblezone has been reduced from levels 10-18 to 14-18. This change is in part, due to performance issues. But I also find that the zone itself is a little barren at times.
- Modified some Bumblezone quest requirements to be easier/shorter.
- You are now expected to stay in the Overworld for longer. As a result, experience from OW quests has been increased by 50%.
- Added actual textures for all unique items (except bows)! Uniques will now also display their appropriate names.
- Added 4 new quests for mechanics that may be overlooked.
- Reduced efficiency of centrifuge, also changed its recipe to use honeycomb.
- High tier honeycomb variants are now harder to come by in The Bumblezone.
- Reduced vanilla mob health. I didn't notice Rough Mobs Revamped was effectively doubling the HP of some of the vanilla mobs... 80+ hp level 2 zombies are not cool.
- Reduced chance for vanilla mobs to spawn with equipment.
- Some general performance changes - should run a little smoother now (YMMV).
- Disabled feral wolves and lammer[...] from Better Animals Plus. It seems like trying to tame them still causes issues even though I thought I disabled taming.
- Reduced tarantula spawns from Better Animals Plus. They were just so, so many.

### Mod Changes
- Updated to Forge 31.2.36.
- Updated MineColonies, Immersive Engineering, Xaero's, Performant, Sound Filters.

- Added Copy-Paste - no longer need to manually update your server configs!
- Removed It's The Little Things since Random Patches offers similar functionality.
- Removed Advanced Skin Customization - causing a few GUI glitches and isn't the most important mod to have for now. Might make a return in the future.

### Fixes
- Mine and Slash uniques compendium can be viewed without crashing now!
- Fixed wording on some quests.
- Fixed up some bow uniques.
