Additionally, more chests will appear, and the multiplier on Mine and Slash items has also increased. I've also removed the crappy vanilla items from the loot tables.

### General Item/Stat Updates
- Added a new rare-ish currency: Orb of Genesis! Rerolls the implicit stat number.
- Added (technically, fixed) a bunch of 'new' Infusions for helmets and leggings. The Infusions found on helmets provide penetration and accuracy stats. The Infusions found on leggings provide stats that grant the wearer a chance to proc an effect when hit, such as + Resource Regen when hit.
- A lot of changes were made to Accuracy as a fair amount of testing was put into it. We now know that a comfortable amount of Accuracy is about 2-3x your level (so at level 50, 100-150 Accuracy). As a result, a lot of the existing flat Accuracy values have been adjusted. I did a sweeping change, pretty much every existing source was lowered, but new ones were added in to compensate. Before, this change, you could basically grab 1-2 sources of Accuracy and be set, which was not intended.
- Armor Penetration has had a similar sweeping numeric change as Accuracy.
- Accuracy and Armor Penetration descriptions have been updated to be more helpful.
- Precise prefix (accuracy) now grants a fair amount of flat Accuracy but can only roll on weapons.
- Added a new Suffix: Of Precision, which can roll on Jewelry, Offhands, and Weapons and grants flat Accuracy.
- Armor and Physical Resist are now multiplicative with each other instead of additive.
- You can no longer roll the generic Gear Defense/Gear Damage Infusions.
- Crafted Gear Potential is now 1x instead of 0.5x.
- Added a new Physical Resistance Infusion for Offhands.
- The Physical Resistance suffix on Offhands and Jewelry have been split. The values on Jewelry have been lowered, and the value for offhands has increased.
- Health/Mana/Energy Regen Necklace now give flat Regen instead.
- Flat Regen can now appear on Necklace Infusions.
- Sources of Health and Magic Shield Regen have been tripled.
- Regen affixes have been buffed.
- Increased the weighting of flat resource regen stats and also increased the number of items they can appear on.
- Health Regen Watcher Eye now grants Max Health Per Sec stat instead of Health Leech Cap increase.
- Corrupt stats which give 5% flat elemental damage now give MORE.
- Elemental weapon Corrupt stats now have a higher weighting.
- The phys to ele Corrupt stats now grant 50% conversion and a small bonus to the damage instead of 20%.
- The Trap and Totem Corrupt stats now grant 8% flat specified damage instead of 4%.
- Helmet Summon Corrupt stat now gives +1 Max Summons instead of +1 Summon Skill Level.
- Helmet Corrupt stat that gives +1 All Skills has been moved to Necklace instead.
- Added 3 new Corrupt stats, one for each offhand type: Skill Damage per Block for Shields, Magic Shield per Mana for Tomes, and Weapon CDR per Attack Speed for Totems.

- Instead of granting Move Speed, Quick Rage now grants 15% chance to gain a Wrath Stack when hit.
- Champion's Frenzied Assault now grants Movement Speed gained as Skill Damage, +1 Max Frenzy Chargesm, and Move Speed per Frenzy Charge instead of dodge and armor synergies.
- Champion's Warrior's Shield now grants damage reduction on low and very low health, and a MORE bonus to Health. It no longer provides synergies with Endurance charges.
- Champion's Cunning now grants critical hit chance instead of dodge per Frenzy charge.
- Champion's Energized Defenses no longer gives a chance to gain Endurance charges. Instead, you now have a chance to gain a Frenzy charge when hit, and you get bonuses to armor and dodge per Frenzy charge.

### Profession Changes
- Added a new Profession Shop! You can access this with the menu wheel. Items in this shop will show up once you reach the correct profession level.
- Husbandry has been removed/rehauled into Bounty Hunting! Complete tasks on the Bounty Board to earn Bounty Hunting experience and Bounty Slips. Bounty Slips can be used in the Profession Shop to purchase materials for other professions, and other fun items.
- Bountiful Boards have been overhauled. Higher reputation boards will give better rewards and more slips.
- Bounty Board objectives have been reworked. The common pool of objectives are tasks that range from Act I to Act V. Tasks that require you to go into later Acts are rarer and their spawn rates are affected by the reputation of the board. Additionally, decrees are more impactful and focused, with many more objectives being added to them that require materials from Act I to Act V.
- New quest entries have been added to introduce the above changes.
- The Profession shop also has a few purchasable items for other professions, including salvaging. There will be more items to come in upcoming updates.
- Profession experience has been reworked a bit. You no longer get penalized for gathering materials that are in higher tiers. Also, the penalty for being too high level is now tier based instead of level based, so at mining level 39, you'll still get full experience from any ores in tier 1 (20-39). The penalty for being too high level is 20% for each difference in tier, instead of 2% per level.
- Emerald is now T1, and Cloggrum is now T2 (they switched places).
- Crafting level 20-40 stuff no longer requires Cloggrum and instead requires Emerald. Cloggrum was only obtainable at level 30.
- Ventium/Falsite are now T4, and Charoite/Diopside are now T5.
- You now gain a bit of salvaging experience when auto-salvaging. You get 10x experience if you use the salvaging station, however.
- Salvaging in a station now grants a chance to salvage additional stones depending on your level. At level 100, output is always doubled.
- Greatly improved the auto-salvaging feature. We now have more options for filtering, and can salvage maps!
- Pitcher Pods added to Farming experience table.
