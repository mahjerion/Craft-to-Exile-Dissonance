**Craft to Exile \[Dissonance]** is a modpack designed around exploration. Mods in the modpack aim to enhance the players' experience with Mine and Slash - a thorough RPG mod dedicated to exploration. This mod draws inspiration from popular action RPGs such as Diablo II and Path of Exile.

At its core, Craft to Exile turns Minecraft into an action RPG which focuses on exploration, character development, and looting. However, [Dissonance] and [Harmony] are sisters and both have different philosophies regarding their development. Although [Harmony] was released later, it is not 'better'. [Harmony] takes advantage of Age of Exile's intrinsic compatibility with vanilla and other mods. Representative of its namesake, it provides player with an experience more akin to vanilla than [Dissonance]. [Harmony] focuses on smaller excursions and a main base. Every so often, mobs will attack you and try to invade your base. To accompany this, mobs scale with your level in every dimension (including the Overworld). Rather than limit dimensions to a narrow level range, in [Harmony], all dimensions have the potential of reaching max level. On the other hand, [Dissonance] was the first of the two packs and features a more linearalized progression ideology. [Dissonance] boasts a very impressive talent and skill tree. On the contrary, [Harmony] drops both of these trees in favour of 'skill gems' which grant the player skills when socketed into a hotbar. Another one of [Dissonance]'s main hallmarks is its fleshed out quest log which guides you through the dimensions and provides a clear goal. After all, a resolution can only be found when there is dissonance.

**TL;DR** - If you're looking for a more streamlined progression system with more in-depth character customization, then I suggest you pick [Dissonance]. If you're looking for a more vanilla-esque experience with strong ARPG elements, or the idea of defending your base from mobs every few nights appeals to you, then pick [Harmony]. It's worth noting that in terms of CPU load, [Harmony] is much lighter.

In the end, you can't really go wrong with either decision and you're welcome to try both! Official servers are provided for both Craft to Exile packs!
